Anti-metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 encephalitis: Five case reports and literature review.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and radiological characteristics of anti-metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) encephalitis. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical data of five patients with anti-mGluR5 encephalitis, and performed a literature review. RESULTS: The five cases included a 52-year-old man who developed a biphasic course of anti-mGluR5 encephalitis after herpes simplex encephalitis, a 22-year-old woman who showed bilateral basal ganglia lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a 36-year-old man with mixed aphasia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a 51-year-old man presented with personality changes, hallucinations, delusions, sleeping disorders and a 58-year-old man with short-term memory deficits and absence seizures.. There are 16 reported cases of anti-mGluR5 encephalitis worldwide. Of all 21 patients, with a median onset age of 35 years old, the main neurological symptoms were cognitive impairment (85.7%, 18/21), psychiatric or behavior problems (76.2%, 16/21), seizures (57.1%, 12/21), sleeping disorders (52.4%, 11/21), different degrees of decreased consciousness (42.9%, 9/21), and movement disorders (23.8%, 5/21). Brain MRI was normal in 11 of 21 patients. Lesions of the limbic lobes were presented in 5 patients, while involvement of other extralimbic regions was also reported. Seven of 21 (33.3%) cases were combined with tumors. Elevated white blood cell counts or specific oligoclonal IgG bands in the cerebrospinal fluid were found in 18 of 21 patients, with marked improvements observed after immunotherapy. DISCUSSION: Patients with anti-mGluR5 encephalitis typically present with diffuse, rather than purely limbic, encephalitis. Anti-mGluR5 encephalitis can be triggered by herpes simplex encephalitis. The risk of a combined tumor may be reduced in anti-mGluR5 encephalitis patients.","Chen S, Ren H, Lin F, Fan S, Cao Y, Zhao W, Guan H",2023 May,10.1002/brb3.3003 e3003,PubMed
Debut with psychotic symptoms of Hashimoto encephalopathy: A case report.,"Hashimoto's encephalopathy is a rare disease, first reported in 1966, with a prevalence of 2.1 in 1000 inhabitants. We present the case of a 42- year- old woman, with no relevant medical history, who suddenly started having symptoms of altered consciousness, visual hallucinations and de-lusions. Laboratory tests showed anti- thyroperoxidase antibodies greater than 600 U/ml, thy-roxin 0.93 U/ml, and thyroid stimulating hormone 1.60 U/ml. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral subcortical focal lesions with a nonspecific demyelinating appearance. The electroencephalogram was nonspecific. The diagnosis of Hashimoto encephalopathy was made, and symptoms remitted after treatment with steroids. This article highlights the importance of conducting a comprehensive evaluation of patients with atypical psychiatric symptoms and a thorough differential diagnosis.","Ortiz Arce AD, Sanchez-Rueda H",2022 Oct 18,10.5867/medwave.2022.09.2566,PubMed
Psychosis Associated with Acquired Porencephaly-Cause or Incidental Finding? Case Report and Review of Literature.,"Porencephaly, a rare disease affecting the central nervous system, is represented by a cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavity in the brain. There are two types of porencephalic cavities: congenital and acquired. Porencephaly is mainly associated with neurological and developmental consequences. Associated psychotic symptoms were reported in a few cases, and due to this fact, there is a knowledge gap regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to such cases. We present the case of a 32-year-old male diagnosed with a psychotic disorder associated with acquired porencephaly. The porencephalic cystic lesions were most probably due to a traumatic brain injury at the age of 6 years old. The psychotic symptomatology consisted of interoceptive/visceral hallucinations, delusions with persecutory and religious/magic content and disorganised behaviour. The porencephalic cavity was confirmed by a computed tomography scan. The patient was treated over the course of time with risperidone, olanzapine and zuclopenthixol. The existing literature regarding other cases of psychosis associated with porencephaly is discussed. In conclusion, even though porencephaly was asymptomatic for a long period of time, we argue that there is a causal relationship between the chronic psychotic symptoms and the porencephalic cyst in our case.","Puiu MG, Dionisie V, Filip AC, Manea M",2022 Apr 24,10.3390/medicina58050586 586,PubMed
Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in older adults: A systematic review of case reports.,"OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the clinical characteristics of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) in older patients. METHOD: A systematic literature review using PubMed and Scopus of all published case reports of NMDARE was undertaken, from database inception to June 2020. From this, cases reporting on patients older than 65 years of age and whose diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies in CSF were selected. RESULTS: 23 case reports fulfilling the study's criteria were found. Median age was 70.1 years (range 65-84), fourteen were female (60.9%), and mostly presented with acute behavioral and cognitive changes (95.7%). Atypical psychosis occurred in eleven patients (47.8%) with a sudden onset and fluctuating clinical pattern of delusions (39.1%), hallucinations (30.4%), and motility disturbances (34.8%) including catatonia (17.4%). Nine patients presented with seizures (39.1%). Pleocytosis in CSF (>5 WBC) was described in twelve cases (52.2%). Eleven cases (47.8%) had abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with limbic inflammatory lesions. Thirteen patients had an abnormal EEG (56.5%). CONCLUSION: NMDARE should be included in the differential diagnosis of older patients who present with new psychiatric episodes, especially when characterized by sudden onset psychotic polymorphic symptomatology, fluctuating course with marked cognitive decline, and with catatonic features.","Gine-Serven E, Serra-Mestres J, Martinez-Ramirez M, Boix-Quintana E, Davi-Loscos E, Guanyabens N, Casado V, Muriana D, Torres-Rivas C, Cuevas-Esteban J, Labad J",2022 Jan-Feb,S0163-8343(21)00162-6 [pii] 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2021.11.006,PubMed
Atypical Charles Bonnet syndrome secondary to frontal meningioma: a case report.,"BACKGROUND: Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is a rare clinical entity that is classically composed of visual hallucinations in the context of an altered optic pathway with preservation of reality judgment. This case aims to present the association of visual hallucinations with complex alterations of the nervous structures adjacent to the visual pathway and an atypical clinical presentation, thus explaining the possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old man presents seeking care due to visual hallucinations with partial preservation of reality judgment and symptoms compatible with a major depressive disorder, including irritability and diminished hygiene habits. He has a history of complete gradual loss of vision and hyposmia. Due to poor treatment response during hospitalization, an MRI was obtained, which showed a frontal tumor lesion with meningioma characteristics adjacent to the olfactory groove and compression of the optic chiasm. He underwent surgical resection of the lesion, which remitted the psychotic symptoms, but preserving the visual limitation and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of visual hallucinations, without other psychotic features as delusions, is a focus of attention for basic structural pathologies in the central nervous system. Affection at any level of the visual pathway can cause CBS. When finding atypical symptoms, a more in-depth evaluation should be made to allow optimization of the diagnosis and treatment.","Diana LL, Carmona-Huerta J, Patino JG, Alejandro AL, Sol DA",2021 Jul 22,10.1186/s12888-021-03360-6 365,PubMed
Nonalcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome Resulting From Psychosis.,"Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) results from thiamine deficiency. If undiagnosed or inadequately treated, WE evolves into Korsakoff syndrome (KS). We herein report a case of nonalcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) that resulted from malnutrition due to psychosis in a 42-years-old male patient. Thiamine deficiency was secondary to severe malnourishment due to poisoning delusions and daily life disorganization in a patient with previously unrecognized schizophrenia. Besides the presence of WE's classic triad of signs, brain magnetic resonance imaging showed also typical thalamic lesions. Furthermore, the patient also presented anterograde and retrograde amnesia, executive dysfunction, and confabulations, compatible with KS being already present. Intravenous treatment with thiamine was given for 37 days. Improvement in cognitive functions and brain imaging alterations was evident. Nevertheless, persistent WKS deficits were present. This case highlights the multiplicity of etiologies of WKS, namely, psychiatric, and its debilitating consequences if not promptly recognized and treated.","Alves Pereira de Carvalho Saraiva R, Goncalves M, Sereijo C, Mendes T, Kamyar RB, Abreu M, Coentre R",2021 Mar 1,10.1097/NMD.0000000000001287,PubMed
Cowden syndrome complicated by schizophrenia: A first clinical report.,"Patients with Cowden syndrome exhibit mucocutaneous lesions, hamartomatous polyposis of the gastrointestinal tract, and macrocephaly, often complicated by malignant tumors, such as breast, thyroid, and uterine cancers. Autism spectrum and epilepsy have been known as neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with Cowden syndrome; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on cases complicated by schizophrenia. Here, we report a first case of Cowden syndrome complicated by schizophrenia. A 49-year-old Japanese woman started experiencing auditory hallucinations in her teens. She had left breast cancer at the age of 34 years, and right breast cancer at the age of 37 years, all of which were surgically treated. She was also being treated by oral medications for Hashimoto's disease. On consulting her previous doctor for abnormal uterine bleeding that lasted for a year, she was diagnosed with endometrial cancer. However, immediately before surgery, her auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions became severe, and she was referred to our hospital for detailed examination and treatment. No abnormalities were found on head MRI, and she was diagnosed with schizophrenia on the basis of neuropsychiatric examination findings. After her psychiatric symptoms were controlled by 2 mg of risperidone, she underwent surgery for endometrial cancer. Although there was no apparent family history, physical findings including macrocephaly and papillomatous skin lesions together with her past medical history of multiple malignant tumors suggested Cowden syndrome. Postoperatively, genetic testing revealed a pathogenic variant c.655C > T; p. Gln219* (NM_000314.4) in PTEN, leading to the confirmation of the diagnosis of Cowden syndrome.","Kobayashi Y, Takeda T, Kunitomi H, Ueki A, Misu K, Kowashi A, Takahashi T, Anko M, Watanabe K, Masuda K, Uchida T, Tominaga E, Banno K, Kosaki K, Aoki D",2020 Aug,S1769-7212(20)30188-9 [pii] 10.1016/j.ejmg.2020.103959,PubMed
"Dreamy State, Delusions, Audiovisual Hallucinations, and Metamorphopsia in a Lesional Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Followed by Ipsilateral Hippocampal Sclerosis.","We report a 65-year-old man who was diagnosed with focal status epilepticus generating a dreamy state, delusions with anxiety, complex audiovisual hallucinations, elementary auditory hallucinations, and metamorphopsia with a growing large lateral temporal lobe lesion. After administrating anti-seizure drugs, all the symptoms disappeared, and brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed ipsilateral hippocampal sclerosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to present all the symptoms in one epilepsy case. On the basis of semiology, electroencephalography, and brain magnetic resonance imaging, we speculated that epileptic activities that have originated from the lateral lesion might have propagated to the ipsilateral mesial temporal lobe, causing hippocampal sclerosis.","Hatano K, Shimizu T, Matsumoto H, Suzuki I, Hashida H",2019 May-Aug,10.1159/000501475,PubMed
Delusional parasitosis as presenting symptom of occipital lobe cerebrovascular accident.,"Delusional parasitosis manifests as a fixed, false belief that an individual is infested by living organisms. Primary delusional parasitosis is a psychiatric disorder with the delusion as an isolated manifestation, whereas secondary delusional parasitosis is a delusion occurring secondary to a psychiatric disorder, substance use, or medical illness. A 62-year-old woman with no psychiatric history presented to the Emergency Department with two to three months of ""whole body itching"" and seeing small insects crawling on her skin and in her hair. Exam of her skin and scalp was notable for no appreciable lesions, rashes, excoriations, or insects. Her neurologic exam was notable for full visual fields, and no localizing deficits. A non-contrast head CT demonstrated a nonspecific heterogeneous low-attenuation lesion within the medial right occipital lobe, and a follow up MRI confirmed a right posterior cerebral artery distribution subacute infarction. She was admitted for two days, and ultimately was discharged on aspirin and atorvastatin for secondary prevention. An emergency physician should remain vigilant in his/her assessment of patients with seemingly psychiatric symptoms, in particular elderly patients with no known psychiatric illnesses. Neuroimaging should be amongst studies considered in the evaluation of elderly patients presenting with new onset psychiatric complaints.","Haas NL, Nicholson A, Haas MRC",2019 Oct,S0735-6757(19)30498-X [pii] 10.1016/j.ajem.2019.158368,PubMed
Precuneus and psychiatric manifestations: Novel neurobiological formulations through lesion based connectivity mapping of psychopathology.,"Lesion-based investigations of psychopathology have preceded contemporary network-neuroscience initiatives. However, brain-lesions detected in routine psychiatric practice are often considered incidental and therefore ignored. Here, we illustrate a strategy to combine individual subject-level lesion information with open-source normative functional-connectomics data to make putative, neuroscience-informed symptom interpretation. Specifically, we report a patient with left precuneus granulomatous lesion and seizures followed by two distinct symptoms - kinetopsia and delusions of nihilism and guilt - which had a differential treatment response. The lesion-based brain-mapping approach could identify correlated (default-mode) and anti-correlated (temporo-parieto-occipital) networks, which enabled a neurobiological formulation of these diverse clinical manifestations.","Narasimha VL, Basavaraju R, Mangalore S, Mehta UM",2019 Jan,S1876-2018(18)30955-9 [pii] 10.1016/j.ajp.2018.12.018,PubMed
Neurological disorders caused by two cerebral alveolar hydatid cysts in an old woman: a rare case report.,"Alveolar hydatid disease, caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, is a life-threatening infectious disease which primarily occurs in the liver. Intracranial hydatid disease is a rare presentation with reported incidence of ~1% of all cases. Here we reported a 60-year-old woman, with the past history of hydatid cysts in her liver, who was presented to us with progressive symptoms consist of headaches, diminished vision, cognitive disorders and delusion. She was disoriented in time, space and person. Bilateral mild papilledema and exaggerated reflexes were observed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed two intra-axial multilucular cystic masses in the fronto-pareital and parieto-occipital regions. The patient underwent two operations and the lesions were removed without any rupture. Medical therapy with Albendazole was started. Neurological symptoms disappeared a few weeks after the surgeries. Although multiple alveolar hydatid cysts are extremely rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intracranial cystic lesions.","Mokhtari H, Sadeghdoust M, Aligolighasemabadi F, Hashemiattar A, Ariabod V, Rahighi S",2017 Aug,10.1093/omcr/omx046 omx046,PubMed
A Case of Attempted Bilateral Self-Enucleation in a Patient with Bipolar Disorder.,"Attempted and completed self-enucleation, or removal of one's own eyes, is a rare but devastating form of self-mutilation behavior. It is often associated with psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia, substance induced psychosis, and bipolar disorder. We report a case of a patient with a history of bipolar disorder who gouged his eyes bilaterally as an attempt to self-enucleate himself. On presentation, the patient was manic with both psychotic features of hyperreligous delusions and command auditory hallucinations of God telling him to take his eyes out. On presentation, the patient had no light perception vision in both eyes and his exam displayed severe proptosis, extensive conjunctival lacerations, and visibly avulsed extraocular muscles on the right side. An emergency computed tomography scan of the orbits revealed small and irregular globes, air within the orbits, and intraocular hemorrhage. He was taken to the operating room for surgical repair of his injuries. Attempted and completed self-enucleation is most commonly associated with schizophrenia and substance induced psychosis, but can also present in patients with bipolar disorder. Other less commonly associated disorders include obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, mental retardation, neurosyphilis, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, and structural brain lesions.","Castro HM, Alvarez J, Bota RG, Yonkers M, Tao J",2017 Mar 22,10.4081/mi.2017.7141 7141,PubMed
Caloric Vestibular Stimulation Reduces Pain and Somatoparaphrenia in a Severe Chronic Central Post-Stroke Pain Patient: A Case Study.,"Central post-stroke pain is a neuropathic syndrome characterized by intolerable contralesional pain and, in rare cases, somatic delusions. To date, there is limited evidence for the effective treatments of this disease. Here we used caloric vestibular stimulation to reduce pain and somatoparaphrenia in a 57-year-old woman suffering from central post-stroke pain. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess the neurological effects of this treatment. Following vestibular stimulation we observed impressive improvements in motor skills, pain, and somatic delusions. In the functional connectivity study before the vestibular stimulation, we observed differences in the patient's left thalamus functional connectivity, with respect to the thalamus connectivity of a control group (N = 20), in the bilateral cingulate cortex and left insula. After the caloric stimulation, the left thalamus functional connectivity with these regions, which are known to be involved in the cortical response to pain, disappeared as in the control group. The beneficial use of vestibular stimulation in the reduction of pain and somatic delusion in a CPSP patient is now documented by behavioral and imaging data. This evidence can be applied to theoretical models of pain and body delusions.","Spitoni GF, Pireddu G, Galati G, Sulpizio V, Paolucci S, Pizzamiglio L",2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0151213 e0151213,PubMed
Meningioma and psychiatric symptoms: A case report and brief review.,"BACKGROUND: Atypical presentation of psychiatric symptoms can lead to a variety of misdiagnoses. Organic causes, including brain tumors, should be considered under these circumstances. METHODS: We present a case report of an 84-year-old woman with irritable, aggressive, and delusional behavior. Her earlier diagnoses included altered mental status, encephalopathy, dementia, nonspecified psychosis, and delirium with delusions. We suspected that a brain tumor could be causing her psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: CT of the head revealed 2 calcified meningiomas, which did not require surgery. Neuropsychological testing results were consistent with frontal lesion type of cognitive and psychotic symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms improved with risperidone. A brief review of the literature is included. CONCLUSIONS: Brain imaging should be considered in cases of atypical psychiatric presentations. Past medical records and neuropsychological testing could assist in the diagnosis.","Madhusoodanan S, Patel S, Reinharth J, Hines A, Serper M",2015 May,,PubMed
Psychosis in primary angiitis of the central nervous system involving bilateral thalami: a case report.,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), a rare inflammatory disease restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), with unusual clinical presentation mimicking schizophrenia. METHOD: Case report. RESULTS: A 45-year-old male presented with alteration of consciousness and confusion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a mass-like enhancing lesion involving bilateral thalami, and biopsy revealed findings compatible with PACNS. The patient was treated with corticosteroids. Psychotic symptoms crystallized over the initial 2 months after the diagnosis and persisted for over a year. Severity of his symptoms improved with gradual normalization of the radiologic findings and antipsychotic medication. CONCLUSION: Our case highlights the importance of considering PACNS as a differential diagnosis of a tumor-like mass lesion in the CNS and the significance of thalamic involvement in the pathogenesis of psychotic symptoms including delusions and hallucinations.","Kim S, Kim DK",2015 May-Jun,S0163-8343(15)00050-X [pii] 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2015.03.006,PubMed
"Capgras syndrome in a very late onset, treatment resistant schizophrenia.","We report a Malay man, with underlying chronic medical illnesses, presenting with positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including Capgras syndrome (CS) at the age of 73. Physical examination and blood investigations were normal and brain CT scan showed age-related cerebral atrophy. Neuropsychological assessment showed probable right hemisphere lesions but relatively intact memory and intellectual functions. Several neuroleptics including depot injections were tried but ineffective. Positive symptoms including CS eventually improved with clozapine before his death from myocardial infarction.

[A case of focal epilepsy manifesting multiple psychiatric auras].,"We present a case of epilepsy with multiple types of focal seizures that were misdiagnosed as psychiatric disorders. A 20-year-old female patient presented with a variety of episodes, including loss of consciousness, deja vu, fear, delusion of possession, violent movements, and generalized convulsions. Each of these symptoms appeared in a stereotypic manner. She was initially diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and treated with psychoactive medications, which had no effect. Long-term video electroencephalography revealed that her episodes of violent movement with impaired consciousness and secondarily generalized seizure were epileptic events originating in the right hemisphere. High-field brain magnetic resonance imaging for detecting subtle lesions revealed bilateral lesions from periventricular nodular heterotopia. Her final diagnosis was right hemispheric focal epilepsy. Carbamazepine administration was started, which successfully controlled all seizures. The present case demonstrates the pitfall of diagnosing focal epilepsy when it presents with multiple types of psychiatric aura. Epilepsy should thus be included in differential diagnoses, considering the stereotypic nature of symptoms, to avoid misdiagnosis.","Ezura M, Kakisaka Y, Jin K, Kato K, Iwasaki M, Fujikawa M, Aoki M, Nakasato N",2015 Jan,10.11477/mf.1416200093,PubMed
"""Crossed"" somatoparaphrenia: an unusual new case and a review of the literature.","Somatoparaphrenia is a delusional misidentification and confabulation of body parts, usually arm or hand, opposite to a cerebral lesion, generally of the ""minor"" right hemisphere. There is some controversy concerning lesion site (fronto-parietal; parieto-temporal; posterior insula, additional subcortical nuclei) or necessary associated symptoms (hemiparesis/plegia, anosognosia, neglect, position sense deficit). We here present a patient who is unusual in many respects, that is: (1) he is a right-hander with somatoparaphrenia after a ""dominant"" left-hemisphere lesion associated with aphasia and ideo-motor apraxia, but also with right hemineglect. He thus has ""crossed"" somatoparaphrenia; (2) his delusional misidentification concerned the right leg and not the arm or hand; (3) he has no anosognosia; (4) his proprioception is disturbed for the leg only; and (5) the lesion site is very posterior, a left occipito-parietal haemorrhage without involvement of the frontal lobe or the posterior insula. We present this case together with the seven other cases of ""crossed somatoparaphrenia"" with and without aphasia we found since 1935 in the literature and discuss their relevance in relation to the above controversies.","Perren F, Heydrich L, Blanke O, Landis T",2015 Jan,10.1007/s00221-014-4101-z,PubMed
A case of Gorlin-Goltz syndrome presented with psychiatric features.,"We report a case of a 34-year-old male who presented with an acute onset of pleomorphic psychiatric features. Upon examination we later diagnosed him with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome based on clinical and radiological findings that are characteristic for this rare autosomal dominant syndrome. His psychiatric manifestations included irritability, aggressive behavior, labile mood, hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and transient cognitive impairment. His past history indicated surgical excision of pigmented lesion in the left lower eyelid which turned out to be a basal cell carcinoma. His past visits to dermatology clinics indicated pitted keratosis involving hands, callosities, and seborrheic dermatitis. There were numerous palmar pits, and Brain CT Head scan revealed extensive calcification along falx cerebri and around the cerebellar vermis. He had low (20 ng/L) vitamin D level and high parathyroid hormone level. The patient improved using antipsychotic medications and vitamin D supplementations for symptomatic management and was discharged with a plan for multispecialty outpatient follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering rare organic etiologies in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms. This is of vital importance for early intervention to prevent complications and for better outcomes of the coexistent diseases.","Mufaddel A, Alsabousi M, Salih B, Alhassani G, Osman OT",2014,10.1155/2014/830874 830874,PubMed
Spontaneous rupture of intracranial dermoid tumor in a patient with vertigo. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings.,"BACKGROUND: Congenital dermoid cysts are very rare, constituting less than 1% of intracranial tumors. Spontaneous rupture of dermoid tumor is a potentially serious complication that can lead to meningitis, seizures, cerebral ischemia and hydrocephalus. Occasionally, dermoid tumors are incidentally discovered on computed tomography (CT) of the brain or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following unrelated clinical complaints. They are also discovered during radiologic investigations of unexplained headaches, seizures, and rarely olfactory delusions. CASE REPORT: In this report we describe a patient complaining of vertigo caused by spontaneous rupture of dermoid cyst, preoperatively diagnosed by CT and MRI. Cranial CT revealed a dense fatty lesion adjacent to the posterolateral parasellar region on the left with multiple small, dense fat droplets scattered in the subarachnoid space corresponding to a dermoid cyst rupture. Cranial MRI sections revealed a lesion with mixed-signal-intensity and multiple hyperintense droplets scattered through the cerebellar surface on the left. No enhancement was found on axial T1-weighted MRI after intravenous Gadolinium administration. Diffusion weighted image (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient map studies exhibited explicit restricted diffusion. DISCUSSION: Many studies and literature case reports concerning the rupture of dermoid cyst have been reported. However, multimodal imaging of this rare pathology in the same patient is uncommon. Although dermoid cysts are pathognomonic in appearance on a CT examination, the MRI is also of value in helping to understand the effect of extension and pressure of the mass. DWI is also important for support of the diagnosis and patient follow-up.","Asil K, Gunduz Y, Ayhan LT, Aksoy YE, Yildiz C",2013 Oct,10.12659/PJR.889172,PubMed
When a loved one feels unfamiliar: a case study on the neural basis of Capgras delusion.,"Perception of familiar faces depends on a core system analysing visual appearance and an extended system dealing with inference of mental states and emotional responses. Damage to the core system impairs face perception as seen in prosopagnosia. In contrast, patients with Capgras delusion show intact face perception but believe that closely related persons are impostors. It has been suggested that two deficits are necessary for the delusion, an aberrant perceptual or affective experience that leads to a bizarre belief as well as an impaired ability to evaluate beliefs. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we compared neural activity to familiar and unfamiliar faces in a patient with Capgras delusion and an age matched control group. We provide evidence that Capgras delusion is related to dysfunctional activity in the extended face processing system. The patient, who developed the delusion for the partner after a large right prefrontal lesion sparing the ventromedial and medial orbitofrontal cortex, lacked neural activity to the partner's face in left posterior cingulate cortex and left posterior superior temporal sulcus. Further, we found impaired functional connectivity of the latter region with the left superior frontal gyrus and to a lesser extent with the right superior frontal sulcus/middle frontal gyrus. The findings of this case study suggest that the first factor in Capgras delusion may be reduced neural activity in the extended face processing system that deals with inference of mental states while the second factor may be due to a lesion in the right middle frontal gyrus.","Thiel CM, Studte S, Hildebrandt H, Huster R, Weerda R",2014 Mar,S0010-9452(13)00287-6 [pii] 10.1016/j.cortex.2013.11.011,PubMed
Psychotic symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus.,"Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus due to idiopathic aqueductal stenosis is a chronic abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the cerebral ventricles caused by an obstruction in the Sylvian aqueduct. This leads to a dilatation of the ventricular system and to subsequent damage of the adjacent parenchyma. Although NPH typically presents with the progressive 'triad' of cognitive impairment, gait disturbance and urinary incontinence, it has been described that it rarely manifests in the form of predominant psychotic symptoms. It has been suggested that thought and perceptual disorders could develop secondary to the damage caused by NPH. Although precise anatomical correlates have not yet been established, certain cerebral regions -primarily the frontal cortex, mesencephalic and diencephalic structures of the brain- have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalic psychosis. Because frontal lobe lesions are traditionally known to facilitate one's inability to integrate and correct perceptual distortions in the face of contradictory evidence, frontal lobe dysfunction may be integral in delineating the etiology of delusions in NPH. We present the case of a 30-year-old female, admitted involuntarily to our acute psychiatric department because she exhibited aggressive behavior while being in an agitated state with delusions of persecution. Her neurological examination disclosed subtle bradykinesia. Neuropsychological batteries and intelligence testing revealed mild cognitive impairment and a CT scan showed considerable dilatation of the ventricular system due to idiopathic aqueductal stenosis. While a conservative approach was chosen for the treatment of NPH, our patient was initiated on 2nd generation antipsychotics showing marked improvement of her psychiatric symptomatology. The atypical presentation of hydrocephalus in the aforementioned case underlines the necessity to thoroughly investigate the possible presence of an underlying organic factor in those patients who present with predominant psychotic symptoms in association with soft non-localising neurological signs and mild cognitive deficits. Furthermore, our patient's marked improvement indicates that, in cases where the primary cause is treated conservatively, hydrocephalic psychosis could respond to 2nd generation antipsychotics. In light of this case report, we reviewed past and present literature on the matter.","Chatziioannidis S, Charatsidou I, Nikolaidis N, Garyfallos G, Giouzepas I",2013 Jul-Sep,,PubMed
Body ownership and attention in the mirror: insights from somatoparaphrenia and the rubber hand illusion.,"The brain receives and synthesises information about the body from different modalities, coordinates and perspectives, and affords us with a coherent and stable sense of body ownership. We studied this sense in a somatoparaphrenic patient and three control patients, all with unilateral right-hemisphere lesions. We experimentally manipulated the visual perspective (direct- versus mirror-view) and spatial attention (drawn to peripersonal space versus extrapersonal space) in an experiment involving recognising one's own hand. The somatoparaphrenic patient denied limb ownership in all direct view trials, but viewing the hand via a mirror significantly increased ownership. The extent of this increase depended on spatial attention; when attention was drawn to the extrapersonal space (near-the-mirror) the patient showed a near perfect recognition of her arm in the mirror, while when attention was drawn to peripersonal space (near-the-body) the patient recognised her arm in only half the mirror trials. In a supplementary experiment, we used the Rubber Hand Illusion to manipulate the same factors in healthy controls. Ownership of the rubber hand occurred in both direct and mirror view, but shifting attention between peripersonal and extrapersonal space had no effect on rubber-hand ownership. We conclude that the isolation of visual perspectives on the body and the division of attention between two different locations is not sufficient to affect body ownership in healthy individuals and right hemisphere controls. However, in somatoparaphrenia, where first-person body ownership and stimulus-driven attention are impaired by lesions to a right-hemisphere ventral attentional-network, the body can nevertheless be recognised as one's own if perceived in a third-person visual perspective and particularly if top-down, spatial attention is directed away from peripersonal space.","Jenkinson PM, Haggard P, Ferreira NC, Fotopoulou A",2013 Jul,S0028-3932(13)00102-4 [pii] 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.03.029,PubMed
Delusions of death in a patient with right hemisphere infarction.,"Although a role for right hemisphere dysfunction has been hypothesized in Cotard delusion, it remains unclear which functions are disturbed. We report here the first known patient with unilateral right hemisphere lesions and delusions of death (1 of the 2 types of Cotard delusion). This man began to believe that he was dead after suffering a right hemisphere infarction involving the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, as well as the thalamus. He had delusions of death in the context of both depersonalization/derealization and delusional misidentifications of people and places. Neuropsychological testing revealed left hemispatial neglect and deficits in general attention. The patient's sense of body ownership and face recognition abilities were preserved. This case suggests that abnormal feelings of familiarity, which have been implicated in several delusional misidentification syndromes, contribute significantly to the development of delusions of death. If this is true, affective processes involved in the identification of people and places and in the feeling of being alive may partially overlap, and these affective processes may be supported by the right hemisphere.","Nishio Y, Mori E",2012 Dec,10.1097/WNN.0b013e31827504c7,PubMed
What is mine? Behavioral and anatomical dissociations between somatoparaphrenia and anosognosia for hemiplegia.,"We describe the clinical manifestations and the lesion patterns of five patients with somatoparaphrenia, the denial of ownership for a paralyzed limb, who showed the rare dissociation from anosognosia for hemiplegia. Similar cases have been only occasionally cited in the literature with scanty descriptions of their symptoms and no detailed anatomical assessment. All patients had extrapersonal and at least mild personal neglect. The lesions pattern was mainly subcortical, with a significant involvement of the right thalamus, the basal ganglia and the internal capsule. A formal comparison between the anatomical pattern previously associated with anosognosia in a study performed in 2005 by Berti and colleagues, and the lesion distribution of each patient clearly shows that our pure somatoparaphrenic patients had a sparing of most of the regions associated with anosognosia for hemiplegia. The behavioral dissociation between SP and anosognosia for hemiplegia, together with this new anatomical evidence, suggests that motor awareness is not sufficient to build up a sense of ownership and therefore these two cognitive abilities are at least in part functionally independent and qualitatively different.","Invernizzi P, Gandola M, Romano D, Zapparoli L, Bottini G, Paulesu E",2013,10.3233/BEN-2012-110226,PubMed
An emerging problem in clinical practice: how to approach acute psychosis.,"Limbic encephalitis (LE) is rare, presents with memory impairment, seizures and behavioral disorder. We present a 44-year-old female with an agitation-depressive disorder associated with delusions and hallucinations, admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of psychosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain and lumbar puncture on admission were normal. Because of clinical deterioration and addition of seizures in the clinical picture, further workup with serum and repeat cerebrospinal fluid studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram disclosed a lesion in the left medial temporal lobe consistent with LE. The patient was treated symptomatically with antidepressive, antipsychotic and anticonvulsant drugs. Aggressive diagnostic tests for the presence of an occult cancer were negative. An 8-year follow up has not revealed a tumor to support a paraneoplasmatic origin of LE. This case, initially diagnosed and treated as psychosis, is a case of non-paraneoplasmatic, non-infective LE, probably caused by an autoimmune mechanism.","Markoula S, Chatzistefanidis D, Konitsiotis S, Kyritsis AP",2012 Jan 1,10.4081/cp.2012.e7 e7,PubMed
Reduplicative paramnesia after a right frontal lesion.,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of reduplicative paramnesia after a focal lesion localized in the right frontal subcortical region. BACKGROUND: It is suggested that a right frontal subcortical lesion alone may be sufficient to cause cognitive disturbance that can develop into reduplicative paramnesia. Clinical data have been scarce. METHOD: We describe the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroradiologic findings of a 69-year-old man with reduplicative paramnesia after a right frontal subcortical lesion. RESULTS: Observation and neuropsychological study showed visuospatial impairment, visual-dominant memory disturbance, anosognosia for cognitive disturbance, and mild frontal dysfunction with paranoid personality. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging study showed a lesion localized in the right inferior posterior frontal subcortical area, and we could define 5 neural pathways involved with the lesion. We supposed that 4 of these were potentially related to reduplicative paramnesia: the medial inferior component of the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the fronto-occipital fasciculus, which are related to visuospatial processing; the anterior thalamic radiation, which is concerned with memory processes; and the uncinate fasciculus, which may be related to abnormal feelings of hyperfamiliarity. CONCLUSIONS: A localized lesion in the right inferior posterior frontal subcortical area can cause cognitive dysfunction that may develop into reduplicative paramnesia. Paranoid personality and the change of the patient's hospital room might have triggered the reduplicative delusion in this case.","Lee K, Shinbo M, Kanai H, Nagumo Y",2011 Mar,10.1097/WNN.0b013e31821129b7,PubMed
Mirrored-self misidentification in a patient without dementia: evidence for right hemispheric and bifrontal damage.,"Mirrored-self misidentification, often referred as the 'mirror sign', is a delusion characterized by the inability to recognize one's own reflected image, often associated with the intact capacity to recognize others in the mirror. It has been described mainly in moderate or severe dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease. In the few reported cases without global cognitive impairment, right hemispheric and frontal dysfunctions have been described. We report a 90-year-old man with abrupt onset of the mirror sign after a minor right hemispheric ischemic stroke. Neuropsychological testing revealed preserved cognitive capacities, except for mild to moderate impairment of visuospatial skills, suggesting right hemisphere dysfunction. Neuroimaging showed a small right dorsolateral frontal infarct, and bifrontal encephalomalacia, consistent with a past history of head trauma. Scattered ischemic white matter lesions in posterior periventricular regions were also seen. It seems that the mirror sign is a multifactorial phenomenon that usually requires right hemispheric dysfunction (perceptual abnormalities, loss of familiarity) and frontal damage (loss of judgement and inability to correct wrong beliefs). The right frontal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seems to have a crucial role in self-recognition.","Villarejo A, Martin VP, Moreno-Ramos T, Camacho-Salas A, Porta-Etessam J, Bermejo-Pareja F",2011 Jun,10.1080/13554794.2010.498427,PubMed
[A case of thiamine deficiency with psychotic symptoms--blood concentration of thiamine and response to therapy].,"We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with thiamine deficiency who showed auditory hallucinations, a delusion of persecution, catatonic stupor, and catalepsy but no neurological symptoms including oculomotor or gait disturbance. Brain MRI did not show high-intensity T2 signals in regions including the thalami, mamillary bodies, or periaqueductal area. Her thiamine concentration was 19 ng/mL, only slightly less than the reference range of 20-50 ng/mL. Her psychosis was unresponsive to antipsychotics or electroconvulsive therapy, but was ameliorated by repetitive intravenous thiamine administrations at 100-200 mg per day. However, one month after completing intravenous treatment, her psychosis recurred, even though she was given 150 mg of thiamine per day orally and her blood concentration of thiamine was maintained at far higher than the reference range. Again, intravenous thiamine administration was necessary to ameliorate her symptoms. The present patient indicates that the possibility of thiamine deficiency should be considered in cases of psychosis without neurological disturbance and high-intensity T2 MRI lesions. Also, this case suggests that a high blood thiamine concentration does not necessarily correspond to sufficient thiamine levels in the brain. Based on this, we must reconsider the importance of a high dose of thiamine administration as a therapy for thiamine deficiency. The validity of the reference range of the thiamine concentration, 20-50 ng/mL, is critically reviewed.","Sasaki T, Yukizane T, Atsuta H, Ishikawa H, Yoshiike T, Takeuchi T, Oshima K, Yamamoto N, Kurumaji A, Nishikawa T",2010,,PubMed
[Stroke-psychosis. Description of two cases].,"INTRODUCTION: The presence of neuropsychiatry symptoms (hallucinations, delusions and agitation) as stroke-related guideline symptoms, thus forming an acute psychosis of organic cause, are extremely uncommon and often correlate with strategic infarcts (caudate nucleus, striatum and thalamus). CLINICAL CASE: We report two cases of stroke-psychosis. Case 1. A 67-year-old man with sudden-onset delusions of persecution and complete recovery in three months. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed infarctions in both head of the caudate nucleus and body of right caudate nucleus. Case 2. A 49-year old man with sudden-onset delusions of persecution and gustative hallucinations that disappeared in three months. The brain MRI revealed small infarction in the left thalamus. DISCUSSION: The possible vascular origin of the psychosis in both cases (sudden onset, complete recover, demonstration of acute ischemic lesion in strategic territory) and the underlying psychopathogenic mechanism (dysfunction of prefrontal cortico-subcortical circuits) is discussed.","Santos S, Alberti O, Corbalan T, Cortina MT",2009 Jul-Aug,,PubMed
[Inaugural psychotic events in multiple sclerosis?].,"INTRODUCTION: Psychotic symptoms are not readily recognized in multiple sclerosis, especially at the beginning of the disease. METHODS: We report the cases of four patients who developed psychotic symptoms that led to the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. We describe the psychiatric and neurological features, MRI findings, clinical outcome and treatment. RESULTS: Two patients developed persecutory delusions, one presented a manic episode and the fourth melancholia with catatonia. Mean age was 39 years (range 20-49 years). Two patients had a personal history, but none a familial history of psychiatric disease. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed an oligoclonal pattern in all patients. All patients fulfilled Barkhof's MRI criteria. Three have had brain MRI with injection during psychotic symptoms. In these three cases, a frontal lesion appeared. The patient with catatonia also had a new lesion in the cerebellum and in the brainstem. All patients needed a ""psychiatric"" treatment, including antipsychotics. The psychiatric event lasted three months for two patients and the two others experienced relapse. CONCLUSION: Acute psychiatric symptom may reveal multiple sclerosis at the beginning of the disease. Frontal lobe localization is suggested. We propose that a psychotic event may correspond to a multiple sclerosis event.","Blanc F, Berna F, Fleury M, Lita L, Ruppert E, Ferriby D, Vermersch P, Vidailhet P, de Seze J",2010 Jan,10.1016/j.neurol.2009.04.014,PubMed
"Disrupted auto-activation, dysexecutive and confabulating syndrome following bilateral thalamic and right putaminal stroke.","OBJECTIVE: Clinical, neuropsychological, structural and functional neuroimaging results are reported in a patient who developed a unique combination of symptoms after a bi-thalamic and right putaminal stroke. The symptoms consisted of dysexecutive disturbances associated with confabulating behavior and auto-activation deficits. BACKGROUND: Basal ganglia and thalamic lesions may result in a variety of motor, sensory, neuropsychological and behavioral syndromes. However, the combination of a dysexecutive syndrome complicated at the behavioral level with an auto-activation and confabulatory syndrome has never been reported. METHODS: Besides clinical and neuroradiological investigations, an extensive set of standardized neuropsychological tests was carried out. RESULTS: In the post-acute phase of the stroke, a dysexecutive syndrome was found in association with confabulating behavior and auto-activation deficits. MRI showed focal destruction of both thalami and the right putamen. Quantified ECD SPECT revealed bilateral hypoperfusions in the basal ganglia and thalamus but no perfusion deficits were found at the cortical level. CONCLUSION: The combination of disrupted auto-activation, dysexecutive and confabulating syndrome in a single patient following isolated subcortical damage renders this case exceptional. Although these findings do not reveal a functional disruption of the striato-ventral pallidal-thalamic-frontomesial limbic circuitry, they add to the understanding of the functional role of the basal ganglia in cognitive and behavioral syndromes.","De Witte L, Engelborghs S, Verhoeven J, De Deyn PP, Marien P",2008,,PubMed
A vanishing lesion in the temporal lobe associated with schizophrenialike psychosis and catatonia.,"OBJECTIVE: To present the case of a patient with hallucinations and psychotic symptoms that co-occurs with a temporary lesion in the left posterior temporal lobe. BACKGROUND: Psychosis and auditory hallucinations are characteristic features of schizophrenia, but may also complicate many somatic diseases. Current functional imaging studies suggest a role of the temporal lobes. METHOD: We describe a patient who initially presented with schizophrenialike psychotic symptoms at an age of 23. She did not respond to antipsychotic medication and developed severe medication-resistant catatonia. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed an opaque left temporal lesion that could not be diagnosed otherwise. Electroconvulsive therapy led to remission of her catatonic and psychotic symptoms. After clinical remission, the temporal lesion had vanished. CONCLUSIONS: The longitudinal association between the lesion and the occurrence and disappearance of psychosis supports current theories on the role of the left temporal lobe in psychosis.","Kho KH, van Veelen NM, Beerepoot LJ, Sommer IE",2007 Dec,,PubMed
"""Far from the heart far from the eye"": evidence from the Capgras delusion.","INTRODUCTION: Capgras syndrome is characterised by the belief that a significant other has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor. These patients have no difficulties with visual recognition but fail to show a skin conductance response (SCR) to the objects of the delusion. A case of Capgras delusion (YY), specifically characterised by the absence of brain lesions, constituted a good opportunity to test the relationship between SCR hyporesponsiveness and eye movement patterns to familiar and unfamiliar faces. METHODS: Visual scan path and SCR were recorded for YY and 8 controls during the presentation of family members' photographs matched with unfamiliar faces of the same sex, age, and physical likeness. Eye movement patterns were explored by selecting three specific areas of interest (AOI) involving the eyes, the mouth, and the face regions. RESULTS: In contrast with controls, YY showed a reduction in number and sum of fixation durations to the eyes (p<.01) and no differential SCRs (p>.05) to familiar vs. nonfamiliar faces. SCR and fixation duration to family members' eyes were significantly correlated (r=.77) in both YY and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Eye region exploration seems to be related to the autonomic reactivity elicited by the affective valence of familiar faces.","Brighetti G, Bonifacci P, Borlimi R, Ottaviani C",2007 May,,PubMed
[Acute psychosis and Behcet's disease: a case report].,"BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease is a multisystem vasculitis of unknown origin. The prevalence of the disease varies widely and is high in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, North Africa, Iran and Japan. Many clinical features of Behcet's disease have been described and the international study group for Behcet's disease has defined a set of diagnostic criteria. These require the presence of recurrent oral ulcers plus two of the following: recurrent genital ulcerations, typical defined eye lesions, typical defined skin lesions or a positive pathergy test (a skin hypersensitivity reaction to a non-specific physical insult; when positive, the response consists of a papule or pustule that develops after 24 to 48 hours at the site of a needle prick to the skin). Although not included in these diagnostic criteria, there are some other features commonly seen in patients with Behcet's disease: thrombophlebitis, oligo-arthritis, gastrointestinal ulcerations and neurological involvement. Neuro-Behcet is well described in Behcet's disease, with variable prevalence rates between 5.3 and 35%. This prevalence is probably affected by the type of study (retrospective or prospective) and regional and ethnic variations in disease expression. Psychiatric symptoms usually occur as incidental findings in some patients with neurological disease; they are misdiagnosed and mistreated. CASE-REPORT: The patient described here developed acute psychotic symptoms without parenchymal cerebral involvement, and negative symptoms during Behcet's disease. Two hypotheses were evoked: schizophrenia associated with Behcet's disease versus psychiatric syndrome induced by vasculitis. Such a case has not been reported in the literature. We describe the case of a 31-year-old Haitian female, admitted because of an acute psychosis. She developed hallucination, misrecognition, psychomotor hyperactivity and delusion about her million childbirths. The patient had three years history of mistreated Behcet's disease, in particular recurrent oral ulcers, iritis and cardiovascular manifestations. She also had a history of uterine tumour, rectal carcinoid tumour and recurrent pleurisies. One year ago, she presented breast lymphangitis, anxiety, unusual thought content, hostility, suspiciousness, and poor impulse control: cranial computerised tomography scan was normal. After ten days of hospitalization, she complained of oral and genital aphta and no neurological sign was found. The cerebral angiographic magnetic resonance imaging showed a thrombophlebitis of the left lateral sinus without parenchymal involvement. Haloperidol, Heparin, Colchicine, Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone were introduced. Six months after, delirium and Behcet's symptoms had disappeared with the following treatment: Risperidone, Alprazolam, Zolpidem, Colchicine, Prednisone, and Azathioprine. The patient has developed enduring negative symptoms: blunted affect, social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation and poor rapport. They are still present. This patient had two acute psychotic symptoms without parenchymal pattern. After treatment, she had persistent negative symptoms and psychosocial deterioration. This evolution is commonly seen in schizophrenia. DISCUSSION: Retrospective analysis of this patient's course suggests that -psychiatric episodes were always associated with physical manifestations. However, pleurisies, lymphangitis, uterine and rectal tumours have never been described in Behcet's disease. This vasculitis occurs less frequently in the Caribbean than in Mediterranean, Middle East or Japan. It seemed that this patient had a psychotic syndrome and a chronic relapsing multisystem disorder, more complex than Behcet's disease. A prospective study would be useful to characterize psychiatric patterns of Behcet's disease and establish their relationships with physical manifestations, especially neurological involvement.","Nkam I, Cottereau MJ",2006 May-Jun,,PubMed
Psychosis in multiple sclerosis associated with left temporal lobe lesions on serial MRI scans.,There is retrospective evidence of a correlation between psychosis in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and temporal lobe pathology. A 35-year-old woman with MS presented with psychosis. There was no concurrent history of medication/substance use or family history. Comparison with previous MRI scans showed significant progression of lesions within the periventricular white matter of the left temporal lobe. This case highlights the association of psychosis and MS progression with worsening of left temporal lobe lesions. Prospective studies are required to ascertain the extent to which left temporal lobe lesions are predictive of future psychosis.,"Reiss JP, Sam D, Sareen J",2006 Feb,,PubMed
Environmental reduplication in a patient with right middle cerebral artery occlusion.,"Environmental reduplication or reduplicative paramnesia is one of the content-specific delusions (CSD) which is characterized by reduplication of places. CSD has been reported in focal and diffuse cerebral disorders. A focal lesion such as frontal lobes and the right hemispheric lesion have been documented The authors describe a 66 year-old woman who had a delusion of misidentification for place one month after right middle cerebral artery occlusion. The patient did not have any history of schizophrenia or other psychiatric diseases. The patient believed that her car, furniture and house were duplicated. She also mentioned that her son and friends tried to takeover all of her properties and told everyone that she was insane. The prominent cortical signs were tactile and visual neglect. Neuropsychological assessments revealed poor attention but she had neither confusion nor dementia. Clock drawing and construction tests revealed visuospatial impairment which was compatible with non-dominant hemispheric abnormality. MRI showed evidence of cerebral infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory. Only one similar patient who had an intracerbral hematoma of the right frontal lobe has been reported in the literature. The role of occipito-parietal and fronto-temporal lobes or their connections in environmental reduplication is proposed.","Likitcharoen Y, Phanthumchinda K",2004 Dec,,PubMed
Xanthogranulomatous hypophysitis mimicking a pituitary neoplasm.,"Hypophysitis is an inflammatory disease of the pituitary gland that clinically and radiologically mimics pituitary tumors. We report here a case of xanthogranulomatous hypophysitis mimicking a pituitary neoplasm.A 65-yr-old woman presented with weight loss, fatigue, and visual disturbance. Computed tomography demonstrated a round cystic low-density mass with calcification in the sella. A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan showed most of the mass as hyperintense. The capsule of the mass was strongly enhanced by gadolinium. Endocrinologic examination revealed hypocorticism and hypothyroidism. Diabetes insipidus (DI) developed after the administration of hydrocortisone. The patient also had hallucination and delusions of persecution. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed. Histologic examination of the removed tissue showed central necrosis surrounded by accumulation of foamy cells and epithelioid cells. Several multinucleated giant cells were also seen. The foamy cells and epithelioid cells were immunopositive for Kp-1, a marker of macrophages. The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery. Although DI and hypofunction of adenohypophysis persisted, the visual disturbance and psychiatric disorder were resolved. We have described an unusual inflammatory lesion of the pituitary in the sellar region that was mimicking neoplasm. A high level of clinical suspicion of inflammatory disorders is necessary for correct diagnosis and optimal management.","Yokoyama S, Sano T, Tajitsu K, Kusumoto K",2004 Winter,,PubMed

Cotard's syndrome with schizophreniform disorder can be successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy: case report.,"We report a case of Cotard's syndrome associated with psychotic symptoms. A 27-year-old man was admitted to hospital with the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. His presenting symptoms, which had started 1 month before hospital admission, were somatic delusions of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular malfunction and the absence of a stomach, which resulted in a decrease in weight from 75 kg to 63 kg in 1 month. Cranial computed tomographic images showed dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles, whereas magnetic resonance imaging revealed central atrophy and lateral ventricle dilatation. Single- photon emission computed tomography demonstrated left temporal, left frontal and left parietal hypoperfusion. The patient did not respond to antipsychotic therapies, but he was successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy. This report emphasizes that Cotard's syndrome may be accompanied by lesions of the left hemisphere and that electroconvulsive therapy could be the first-line therapy in such patients with psychotic disorder.","Caliyurt O, Vardar E, Tuglu C",2004 Mar,,PubMed

Belief and awareness: reflections on a case of persistent anosognosia.,"Persisting anosognosia after acute lesions is relatively rare, and no case studies to date have reported functional scanning investigation of this disorder. This is a case report of an 85-year-old right-handed Scottish woman, EN, who showed persistent anosognosia for hemiplegia following a haemorrhagic stroke. Extensive damage in the right hemisphere caused left upper and lower limb flaccid hemiplegia and severe left-sided neglect. Lack of awareness for her deficits was still present 2 years after the stroke, when neurological, neuropsychological, and SPECT examinations were performed. Testing revealed severe left unilateral neglect and poor performance on verbal fluency tasks. EN had age normal memory performance, and her object recognition and praxic abilities were preserved. She showed no global reasoning or language problems apart from her abnormal beliefs. EN believed that she was able to walk and carry out several activities, in a context of other disorders of belief. SPECT scan showed marked hypoperfusion in the right parietotemporal cortex and this extended to the associative cortex in the right frontal regions. The persistence of anosognosia in this patient cannot be explained by memory impairments or global cognitive decline. A possible account might be that alteration in awareness was maintained by contingent right frontal and/or parietal dysfunction causing a suspension or change in the ability to monitor and check the 'real' and especially to assess the veracity of mental contents.","Venneri A, Shanks MF",2004,,PubMed
[Back to the high school days: an abnormal remembering characterized by concurrent as well as alternating feeling to be in the past and present].,"After the successful treatment of a hypothalamic germinoma, a 31-year-old right-handed male developed a difficulty in memory and admitted to our department for detailed evaluation. Neuropsychologically he showed no personality change, confabulation, misidentification, delusion or disorientation to physical time. Neither aphasia, dementia or frontal lobe dysfunction was found. However, he showed a moderate degree of anterograde amnesia and a retrograde amnesia for the last 5 years judged by a public events test. Moreover, his temporal markings of a correctly remembered event in the post high school days shifted strongly toward the high school days. This temporal location abnormality was largely limited to the events from the days of his graduation from the high school to the period 5 years prior to the present incident. He felt personal events happened during this period as if they had occurred in the high school days, although he well knew that they actually happened much later. At the same time he felt that memories of the high school days were abnormally vivid and recent. Most interestingly, he was found to have been experiencing a funny feeling that he was living in the high school days and the present at the same time. The feeling occurred either simultaneously or alternatively. In the latter instance, he would suddenly start behaving as if he were a high school student. He would start urging his wife to go to the school together immediately. This behavior would be over in several minutes. His consciousness was clear in these instances and there was no amnesia for these periods. A brain MRI with gadolinium enhancement showed a lesion extending in the hypothalamus, anterior thalamus, basal forebrain and midbrain bilaterally. After eight months this abnormality of temporal sensation disappeared. However, tendency to make the date of public event nearer to the high school period persisted. We hypothesize that impaired temporal estimation for an event recalled from the retrograde memory store and mis-arousal of familiarity evoked at the time of spontaneous recollection are responsible for double feeling of time of an experience. These phenomenon might be attributable to the partial destruction of the Papez' and the basolateral limbic circuits.","Hashimoto R, Hirayama K, Fujii T, Yamadori A",2003 Mar,,PubMed
The delusions of Capgras and intermetamorphosis in a patient with right-hemisphere white-matter pathology.,"Previous neuropsychological studies have demonstrated an association between person misidentification and right-hemisphere dysfunction. In the study reported here, we explore the contribution of facial and visual recognition impairments in a patient with right-hemisphere subcortical white-matter pathology in the frontal and parietal lobes and a diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment. The patient displayed false recognition of unfamiliar faces and deficient retrieval of key biographic detail for famous faces. These results are discussed in the context of the contribution of deficiencies in the visual system and subcortical white-matter lesions to the development of Capgras delusion.","Edelstyn NM, Oyebode F, Barrett K",2001 Nov-Dec,,PubMed
Mirrored-self misidentification: two cases of focal onset dementia.,"We present two patients in whom the mirror sign, the inability to recognize one's own reflected image, was a stable and persisting symptom signalling the onset of a progressive dementing illness. Extensive neuropsychological testing was conducted with both patients, with particular emphasis on face processing and the understanding of reflected space. Both patients were also investigated with structural imaging techniques (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging). Although the neuroimaging results were not strongly lateralizing for either patient, neuropsychological testing revealed striking right hemisphere dysfunction with relatively intact left hemisphere cognitive function in both patients. Of particular interest was the patients' dissociation on tests of face processing; one patient, FE, had significant face processing deficits while the other patient, TH, had relatively intact face processing. Further testing with TH revealed striking deficits in his ability to interpret reflected space. The results of the face processing tests are discussed in the context of current models of normal face processing, with particular emphasis on the affective component in face recognition. We propose that a combination of cognitive deficits underlie the mirror sign delusion, including perceptual, affective and reasoning impairments, and also discuss the contributions of cortical and subcortical lesions in these two patients and in delusions in general.","Breen N, Caine D, Coltheart M",2001,,PubMed
"[A-56-year-old woman with parkinsonism, whose mother had Parkinson's disease].","We report a 56-year-old woman with progressive gait disturbance. Her mother had Parkinson's disease with onset at age 70. She died at age 74 and the post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of Lewy body positive Parkinson's disease. The patient was well until the age of 50(1995) when she noted an onset of resting tremor and difficulty of gait. She also developed delusional ideation and was admitted to a psychiatric service of another hospital, where a major tranquilizer was given. The delusion disappeared but she developed marked rigidity. The major tranquilizer was discontinued and an anticholinergic and amantadine HCl were given. She showed marked improvement to Hoehn and Yahr stage II and was discharged. In 1995, when she was 52 years of the age, she developed delusion again and a major tranquilizer was given. She developed marked parkinsonism again and became Hoehn and Yahr stage V. The major tranquilizer was discontinued and she was treated with levodopa/carbidopa, trihexyphenidyl, bromocriptine, and dops. She improved remarkably to stage II. She was admitted to our service on October 8, 1996 for drug adjustment. She was alert and not demented. She was anxious but delusion or hallucination was noted. Higher cerebral functions were intact. Cranial nerve functions were also intact except for masked face and small voice. Her posture was stooped and steps were small. She showed retropulsion and moderate bradykinesia. Resting tremor was noted in her left hand. Rigidity was noted in both legs. No cerebellar ataxia or weakness was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were within normal range and sensation was intact. Her cranial MRI revealed some atrophic changes in the putamen, in which a T 2-high signal linear lesion was seen along the lateral border of the putamen bilaterally. In addition, posterior part of the putamen showed T 2-low signal intensity change. She was treated with 1.6 mg of talipexole, 6 mg of trihexyphenidyl, and 100 mg of L-dops. She was in stage III of Hoehn and Yahr. She developed neurogenic bladder with a large amount of residual urine for which she required catheterization. She was transferred to another hospital. Despite drug adjustment, she lost response to levodopa and her parkinsonism deteriorated gradually. She also developed syncope orthostatic hypotension. In April of 1998, she developed intracerebral hemorrhage and was admitted again on April 19, 1998. She was unable to stand and showed marked akinesia and rigidity. She was in stage V of Hoehn and Yahr. Her cranial CT scan revealed bilateral high-density lesions in the posterior parietal lobes. She developed dysphagia for which she required gastrostomy. She was transferred to another hospital but her clinical condition deteriorated further. On December 22, 1999, she developed fever and dyspnea and was admitted to our service again. She developed cardial arrest at the emergency room from hypoxia. She was resuscitated; however, she was comatose with loss of brain stem reflexes. Later on she developed generalized myoclonus. She developed cardiac arrest and pronounced dead on December 28, 1999. The patient was discussed in a neurological CPC. The chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that the patient had striatonigral degeneration because of poor response to levodopa in the later course, autonomic failures, and MRI changes. Some other participants thought that the patient had a form of familial Parkinson's disease. Opinions were divided into these two possibilities. Post-mortem examination revealed that the substantia nigra showed intense neuronal loss and gliosis, however, no Lewy bodies were seen. In addition, intracytoplasmic inclusions were seen in oligodendrocytes. The putamen was markedly atrophic in its posterior part with marked gliosis and neuronal loss. The ventromedial part of the pontine nucleus also showed neuronal loss and intracytoplasmic glial inclusions. Pathologic diagnosis was multiple system atrophy. In the parietal lobe, an arteriovenous malformation with bleeding was noted. This is very unique case. Although her mother had Lewy body-positive Parkinson's disease, the patient had Lewy body-negative multiple system atrophy with a-synuclein-positive glial inclusions. Whether this is just a coincidental occurrence or the presence of a genetic load for Parkinson's disease might triggered her multiple system atrophy is an interesting question to be answered in future.","Shimo Y, Takanashi M, Ohta S, Terashima K, Mori H, Shirai T, Miwa H, Mizuno Y",2001 May,,PubMed
Magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients with delusional disorder due to diffuse cerebrovascular disease: a report of seven cases.,"Delusions associated with cerebrovascular diseases have been sporadically reported. Although both psychiatrists and neurologists attempted to link delusions with anatomical locations of the brain lesion, comorbid psychiatric and neurological disorders make the interpretation of delusions difficult. The purpose of the present paper is to report the clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics in patients with delusional disorder due to diffuse cerebrovascular diseases, and to redefine the concept of 'vascular delusion'. The clinical features and MRI findings were reviewed retrospectively in a series of seven patients with 'delusional disorder due to cerebrovascular disease' as defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSMIV). The average age of onset is 64. No patient had a prior personal or family history of major psychiatric illness. The illness is presented as acute, subacute or stepwise course. Hypertension was present in all patients. Two had diabetes mellitus, and one had atrial fibrillation. Three had clinical evidence of previous cerebrovascular attacks, only one showed minor neurological deficits. Three had diffuse cortical slow wave in electroencephalogram. No patient had significant cognitive impairment but had multiple cortical and subcortical cerebrovascular lesions in MRI, with white-matter lesions (WML) in bilateral frontal areas. Delusional disorder due to diffuse cerebrovascular change is characterized by late-onset, stepwise course, and comorbid medical and neurological diseases. The results of vascular changes in the present study did not establish a cause-effect relationship and should be considered as multifactorial in pathogenesis. The findings suggested the hypothesis of neural circuit theory. Further studies in larger numbers of patients and newer neuroimaging techniques are needed to expand the knowledge learned from these findings.","Su KP, Hsu CY, Hsieh SC, Shen WW",2001 Apr,,PubMed
Acquired obsessive-compulsive disorder associated with basal ganglia lesions.,"The authors report 5 cases of acquired obsessive-compulsive disorder occurring later in life.

[Somatoparaphrenia. A positive variant of anosognosia for hemiplegia].,"Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP), i.e., unawareness of motor deficits and associated disorders, has been frequently reported, pre-dominantly following right hemispheric lesions. To a smaller extent, there are case reports of patients who give accounts of a feeling of strangeness concerning the contralesional limbs and sometimes attribute them to other persons. This ""positive-variant"" of AHP has been labeled ""somatoparaphrenia"" (SP). We report a case of SP in a 85-year-old woman with infarction of the right posterior cerebral artery and posterior parts of the right thalamus. She showed AHP and described her left side alternatively as her handicapped nephew and a clumsy cat. Misidentification of her daughter also occurred. With respect to the literature the predominant neuroanatomical features involved are lesions including right parietal cortex and/or posterior parts of the thalamus. Theories concerning the pathogenesis of this phenomenon comprise a denial of the illness, a lack of awareness caused by reduced sensory feedback and neglect, a misidentification or disturbance of the active discovery process considered necessary for realizing one's disorder.","Paulig M, Weber M, Garbelotto S",2000 Feb,,PubMed
A case of psychotic disorder associated with a right temporal lesion: a special reference to magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography findings.,"A case of psychotic disorder with a right temporal lesion was reported. The patient, a 19 year old male, who underwent a brain surgery to remove the trigeminal Schwannoma, occupying from the right cerebellopontine angle to the right middle cranial fossa. One year postoperatively, he presented with a psychotic disorder, including auditory hallucinations, delusions of persecution and reference, thought hearing, thought insertion and passive experiences. T1-weighted images on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a low intensity signal area in the right temporal cortex and white matter. T2-weighted images demonstrated a high intensity signal within the same region. Single photon emission computed tomograghy (SPECT) demonstrated a severe low perfusion corresponding to the region in which the MRI demonstrated the abnormalities. The clinical and neuroimaging studies of this case suggest that psychotic disorder may occur in association with a right temporal lesion and MRI and SPECT are useful to evaluate an organic basis for the psychotic disorder.","Mizukami K, Yamakawa Y, Yokoyama H, Shiraishi H, Kobayashi S",1999 Oct,,PubMed
Refractory symptomatic schizophrenia resulting from frontal lobe lesion: response to clozapine.,"A 34-year-old man with a 10-year history of persistent auditory hallucinations and passivity delusions had failed to respond to a variety of conventional antipsychotic medications. He had a history of head trauma 8 years before the onset of psychiatric symptoms. Recent investigations revealed a post-traumatic infarct, situated in the left frontal lobe, on a magnetic resonance imaging scan. Treatment with clozapine for more than 2 years resulted in a marked improvement in his psychotic symptoms. The localization of the brain lesion may be related to the etiology of his symptoms and to the clinical response to clozapine.","Burke JG, Dursun SM, Reveley MA",1999 Nov,,PubMed
Bilateral anterior cortical atrophy and subcortical atrophy in reduplicative paramnesia: a case-control study of computed tomography in 10 patients.,"OBJECTIVE: Reduplicative paramnesia (RP) is thought to be related to other delusional misidentification syndromes (DMS) such as Capgras syndrome. DMS are thought to occur when brain lesions disrupt cortical functioning. This study tests this hypothesis and tries to understand whether focal lesions are as important in the etiology of RP as they are in other types of DMS. METHOD: The computed tomography (CT) scans of 10 consecutive psychiatric inpatients with RP and another principal psychiatric diagnosis were compared with those of control patients without RP matched for age, sex, and principal psychiatric diagnosis. The scans were assessed blindly by a neuroradiologist using a previously published rating scale for the presence of lesions in 11 discrete anatomic areas. The differences between the 2 groups were examined statistically using log-linear analysis. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that index patient cortical atrophy, cortical fissure enlargement, and deep brain atrophy distinguished the 2 groups significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral anterior cortical, brain stem, and cerebellar vermis atrophy and dysfunction may be important in the pathogenesis of RP in particular and of DMS in general.","Joseph AB, O'Leary DH, Kurland R, Ellis HD",1999 Sep,,PubMed
Confabulation and delusional misidentification: a four year follow-up study.,"We describe a patient, AZ, who showed, in addition to an amnesic syndrome which eventually improved, longstanding confabulation and delusional misidentification following bilateral frontal and right temporal post-traumatic lesions. Confabulation appeared in personal recollections and on long-term verbal memory testing. Misidentification concerned mainly his wife and house. During the four year follow-up AZ's confabulation progressively shrinked so as to become restricted to verbal memory tasks. By contrast, misidentification persisted. General semantic memory was unimpaired throughout, while performance on frontal tests was initially poor and partly improved in time. We argue that confabulation and misidentification, though often intermingled and occurring after similar lesion pattern, should be considered as different neuropsychological entities.","Mattioli F, Miozzo A, Vignolo LA",1999 Jun,,PubMed
Neuropsychologic implications in erotomania: two case studies.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore neuroanatomic substrates and cognitive factors associated with erotomania through neuropsychologic test data and neurologic studies. BACKGROUND: Erotomania is a delusional disorder that has been examined and conceptualized both clinically and psychodynamically. It is believed that neuroanatomic and neuropsychologic correlates can provide important insights into the causes of erotomania. METHOD: Two patients with erotomania and the results of their neuropsychologic testing were examined, and neurologic studies also were examined for one of the patients. These data were compared with case studies from the literature. RESULTS: Neuropsychologic test results suggested that erotomania may be associated with deficits in cognitive flexibility and associative learning that are mediated by frontal-subcortical systems, and with deficits in verbal and visuospatial skills. Neurologic studies suggested abnormalities in temporal areas. CONCLUSIONS: Visuospatial-functioning deficits or limbic lesions, particularly in the temporal lobes, in combination with isolative and ambivalent romantic experiences, may contribute to misinterpretations in erotomania, and deficits in cognitive flexibility may contribute to the maintenance of the delusional belief.","Fujii DE, Ahmed I, Takeshita J",1999 Apr,,PubMed
[Clinical judgment and decision making in clinical practice. A music conductor with epilepsy followed by memory disorders].,"A 40-year-old conductor was admitted because of increasing drowsiness and confusion. Two years before admission he had had a first seizure. One year before admission he had a generalized convulsive status epilepticus; the following months he was less able to concentrate. A second status epilepticus was followed by transient weakness of his left arm and a depressed level of consciousness for several weeks. After awakening, he had delusions, and his wife found him demented. In the following months his confusion and drowsiness gradually deteriorated. He had previously had gonorrhoea, an episode of fever and exanthema, and was found to have oligospermia as cause of his infertility. On examination he was disoriented, and he had dysarthria. His left pupil was smaller, but both pupils reacted normally. There was left hemianopia and cerebellar ataxia. CT and MR showed large ventricles and periventricular diffuse lesions in the white matter. CSF examination revealed leucocytosis and increased protein content. Further examination were focussed on serological evidence of syphilis, and finally neurosyphilis was diagnosed. After treatment with penicillin, the patient started to recover.","Rinkel GJ, Brouwers PJ, Lambrechts DA",1997 Apr 12,,PubMed
Sneddon's syndrome (livedo racemosa and cerebral infarction) presenting psychiatric disturbance and shortening of fingers and toes.,"A 24-year-old man with livedo racemosa and psychiatric disturbances, manifesting as low intelligence (IQ 80) and delusions, had anti-cardiolipin antibody and showed shortening of the fingers and toes. A skin biopsy of the livedo lesion revealed endoarteritis obliterans, being compatible with Sneddon's syndrome. MRI of the brain demonstrated multiple infarction and moderate cortical atrophy. A single photon emission tomography of the brain showed a marked reduction of the blood flow in the front-temporal lobe. These findings might relate to the psychiatric disturbance. After intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide and the start of oral prednisolone, the anti-cardiolipin antibody level decreased and his physical condition improved. However, a low dose of haloperidol is still necessary to maintain his mental condition.","Kume M, Imai H, Motegi M, Miura AB, Namura I",1996 Aug,,PubMed

MRI and SPECT of Klinefelter's syndrome with various neuropsychiatric symptoms: a case report.,"We present here magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography with 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP-SPECT) of a patient suffering from Klinefelter's syndrome with various neuropsychiatric symptoms. He was a 30-year-old male, who showed impaired consciousness seizures, auditory hallucination, delusion of reference, delusion of grandeur, psychomotor excitement and intellectual impairment. Although no focal lesion was detected by computed tomography or T1-weighted MRI, T2-weighted MRI provided a heterogeneous high-signal-intensity lesion of the inferior part of the left temporal lobe, which was not enhanced with Gd-DTPA. In addition 123I-IMP-SPECT exhibited focal hypoperfusion in the left temporal lobe on the early images. We suggest that the neuropsychiatric symptoms of this case are associated with the focal organic brain dysfunction which was revealed by MRI and 123I-IMP-SPECT.","Miyamoto A, Kitawaki K, Koida H, Nagao K",1993 Dec,,PubMed
[A case of Meige's syndrome associated with post head trauma].,"The pathogenesis of Meige's syndrome (MS) is controversial and has yet to be determined up to today. We studied a case of MS associated with post head trauma. The patient was a 52-year-old female. At the age of 46, she began to suffer from oro-lingual dystonia after head trauma induced by a traffic accident and the brief administration of neuroleptics to the delusion deteriorated the dystonia. She showed a wry appearance after 1 year and 6 months of the trauma and began to exhibit blepharospasms, oro-mandibular dystonia and cervical dystonia after 2 years and 3 months. For these symptoms her daily life became difficult. These symptoms were resistant to various drug therapies, although trihexyphenidyl relieved the symptoms transiently. Laboratory examinations and cranial MRI findings were normal. By surface electromyogram of ocular orbicular muscles, bilateral continuous discharge was observed. This patient was diagnosed as MS by clinical symptoms and surface electromyogram findings. It was inferred that the head trauma was associated with the development of MS. We discussed the pathogenesis of MS in the present case and it was speculated that MS was presented by a minute lesion of the brain stem which was produced at the time of the head trauma.","Kimura T, Deshimaru M, Inukai K, Matsunaga T, Miyakawa T",1992 Nov,,PubMed

We report the case of a patient who suffered a sudden delirium, expression of a probable right lenticular cerebral toxoplasmosis. This 35-year-old male homosexual, who had no psychiatric history, suddenly developed in November 1988 the following psychiatric signs: he started to walk back and forth incessantly, he had the impression that he was the subject of the conversations of the passers-by, that all the posters and notices refer to him, and that he was God. He was admitted in a psychiatric department where the symptoms were progressively curbed by neuroleptics (cyamemazine 75 mg, and haloperidol 15 mg). The episode was not questioned by the patient, but attributed to bad eating habits. HIV-positivity had been discovered a year later (during systematic screening). A computerized tomographic (CT) scan performed subsequently to this delirium was interpreted as normal. Four weeks later the patient was referred to us. The psychiatric condition was stabilized in spite of a certain aggressiveness and the probable persistence of an underlying delirium state. Laboratory examinations showed the following: blood count revealed leukopenia (2.2 G/l) and thrombocytopenia (135 G/l; OKT4/OKT8 ratio was 0.08; CSF: normal; sputum culture evidenced the presence of pneumocystis carinii; EEG were normal.

Multiple sclerosis and affective disorders.,"Affective disorders occurring in association with multiple sclerosis have been attributed both to the psychosocial impact of a chronic disabling illness and to the structural lesions of cerebral demyelination. A review of research evidence suggests that while there is a correlation between chronic depressive symptoms and both progressive disability and lack of social support, acute major depressive and manic episodes may be psychiatric manifestations of demyelinating lesions and may be the initial presenting symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Anti-inflammatory agents may be required in the management of acute psychiatric symptoms despite the fact that these agents have a propensity to precipitate psychotic episodes. Two case reports are presented to illustrate the clinical challenge of distinguishing between organic and functional affective illness in patients with multiple sclerosis. The interplay between biological and psychological aspects of multiple sclerosis in precipitating affective disorders is discussed, with implications for patient assessment and management.","Garland EJ, Zis AP",1991 Mar,,PubMed

[Melanomatous meningitis. Apropos of 3 cases].,"The meninges are frequently involved during the dissemination of malignant melanoma. This ""meningeal melanoma"" ranks fairly high on the list of metastatic meningites, side by side with meningeal carcinomatosis proper (i.e. related to a malignant epithelial tumour). Meningeal melanoma may be associated with a cerebral metastasis or isolated, as in the three cases reported here. Although its prognosis is sombre, its diagnosis is important since the possibilities of treatment are limited but exist. CASE-REPORTS: Case 1. This was a 68-year old woman who had initially presented with malignant melanoma in the maxillary region (SSM level IV, thickness 2.9 mm). Two years after the primary tumor was excised, secondary lesions developed in the lymph nodes and bones. A few weeks later, the patient fell into mental confusion progressing towards delusion of persecution. Neurological examination and CT scans were normal, but numerous melanoma cells were found in the CSF. This woman died one month after the first neurological signs had appeared. Case 2. This 63-year old man presented with bilateral axillary adenopathy and inflammatory thoracic plaques which at histology had proved to be metastases from a malignant melanoma of the shoulder surgically treated 10 years previously. After 14 months of almost complete remission under multiple chemotherapy (CPDD, ACTD, VDS), headaches and lumbosacral pain developed. Standard radiography and CT of the spine gave normal results, and it was only at the third lumbar puncture that the CSF was found to contain malignant cells. The patient died 2 months after the first neurological manifestations. Case 3. A 42-year old woman developed headaches and dysesthaesia in the arms and head. This was followed by oppositional semi-mutism. All exploratory examinations were normal, except for that of the CSF which showed 18 cells/mm3, 50 p. 100 of which were melanoma cells. The patient was transferred to the Dermatology department where he underwent excision of a left scapular melanoma difficult to classify (malignant blue naevus?). Combined treatment with Fotemustine* and DTIC produced an incomplete but relatively prolonged response. Death occurred after 8 months. DISCUSSION: A. Meningeal melanoma accounts for about 10 p. 100 of all metastatic meningites. The most frequent primary tumours in meningeal carcinomas are breast cancer and lung cancer. Malignant melanoma ranks third or fourth, but when the relative frequency of each of these three malignant diseases is taken into account, it appears that the risk of malignant melanoma is higher than that of any other solid tumour. B. In 410 cases extracted from the literature, the meninges were involved in 30 p. 100 of malignant metastatic melanomas found at autopsy. There is no publication that makes it possible to evaluate the relative frequency of melanomas affecting only the meninges or coexisting with cerebral metastases.

[Right hemiasomatognosia and sensation of amputation caused by left subcortical lesion. Role of callosal disconnection].,"A 72-year-old right-handed hypertensive man presented with a right brachial monoplegia, and hypesthesia of the right half of the body to touch and pricking, sparing the face. A CT scan 2 weeks later showed a spontaneous hyperdense area corresponding to a left subcortical parietal hematoma. The patient used his spontaneous language to express body image disturbances: intense prolonged feeling of amputation related to the upper limb and foot on the right side, hemiasomatognosia without anosognosia, autotopagnosia. Also associated were a right-sided visual negligence and a more general inability to handle spatial data leading to a temporospatial disorientation. Mild language disorders were suggestive of subcortical aphasia: normal incitation and repetition; with semantic paraphasias, poor verbal fluency. Furthermore comprehension of orders or propositions concerning spatial data were poor. Finally, there were signs suggestive of callosal disconnection: paradoxical extinction of the left ear during dichotic listening, agraphia and anomia of the left hand, ideomotor apraxia of the left upper limb, difficulty in visual transfer. The lesion interrupted thalamic tracts to parietal regions and callosal fibers linking parieto-occipital association areas. This twofold lesion was analyzed for each of the neuropsychological disturbances observed. Certain aspect of cerebral function in this patient were reminiscent of ""split-brain"" disorders. The left hemisphere which ""speaks"" fails to understand the feelings of the right hemisphere: unfamiliarity of places, sensations of illness, resulting in an unadapted speech. The pathophysiology of feeling of amputation is discussed.","Cambier J, Elghozi D, Graveleau P, Lubetzki C",1984,,PubMed
APIS: A paired CT-MRI dataset for ischemic stroke segmentation challenge,"Stroke is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide. Immediate
attention and diagnosis play a crucial role regarding patient prognosis. The
key to diagnosis consists in localizing and delineating brain lesions. Standard
stroke examination protocols include the initial evaluation from a non-contrast
CT scan to discriminate between hemorrhage and ischemia. However, non-contrast
CTs may lack sensitivity in detecting subtle ischemic changes in the acute
phase. As a result, complementary diffusion-weighted MRI studies are captured
to provide valuable insights, allowing to recover and quantify stroke lesions.
This work introduced APIS, the first paired public dataset with NCCT and ADC
studies of acute ischemic stroke patients. APIS was presented as a challenge at
the 20th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2023, where
researchers were invited to propose new computational strategies that leverage
paired data and deal with lesion segmentation over CT sequences. Despite all
the teams employing specialized deep learning tools, the results suggest that
the ischemic stroke segmentation task from NCCT remains challenging. The

Segmentation Ability Map: Interpret deep features for medical image segmentation,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for medical
image segmentation. In most studies, only the output layer is exploited to
compute the final segmentation results and the hidden representations of the
deep learned features have not been well understood. In this paper, we propose
a prototype segmentation (ProtoSeg) method to compute a binary segmentation map
based on deep features. We measure the segmentation abilities of the features
by computing the Dice between the feature segmentation map and ground-truth,
named as the segmentation ability score (SA score for short). The corresponding
SA score can quantify the segmentation abilities of deep features in different
layers and units to understand the deep neural networks for segmentation. In
addition, our method can provide a mean SA score which can give a performance
estimation of the output on the test images without ground-truth. Finally, we
use the proposed ProtoSeg method to compute the segmentation map directly on
input images to further understand the segmentation ability of each input
image. Results are presented on segmenting tumors in brain MRI, lesions in skin
images, COVID-related abnormality in CT images, prostate segmentation in
abdominal MRI, and pancreatic mass segmentation in CT images. Our method can
provide new insights for interpreting and explainable AI systems for medical
image segmentation.

Dual Adversarial Learning with Attention Mechanism for Fine-grained Medical Image Synthesis,"Medical imaging plays a critical role in various clinical applications.
However, due to multiple considerations such as cost and risk, the acquisition
of certain image modalities could be limited. To address this issue, many
cross-modality medical image synthesis methods have been proposed. However, the
current methods cannot well model the hard-to-synthesis regions (e.g., tumor or
lesion regions). To address this issue, we propose a simple but effective
strategy, that is, we propose a dual-discriminator (dual-D) adversarial
learning system, in which, a global-D is used to make an overall evaluation for
the synthetic image, and a local-D is proposed to densely evaluate the local
regions of the synthetic image. More importantly, we build an adversarial
attention mechanism which targets at better modeling hard-to-synthesize regions
(e.g., tumor or lesion regions) based on the local-D. Experimental results show
the robustness and accuracy of our method in synthesizing fine-grained target
images from the corresponding source images. In particular, we evaluate our
method on two datasets, i.e., to address the tasks of generating T2 MRI from T1
MRI for the brain tumor images and generating MRI from CT. Our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under comparison in all datasets and
tasks. And the proposed difficult-region-aware attention mechanism is also
proved to be able to help generate more realistic images, especially for the
hard-to-synthesize regions.","Dong Nie, Lei Xiang, Qian Wang, Dinggang Shen",2019-07-07,,arXiv
ISLES 2024: The first longitudinal multimodal multi-center real-world dataset in (sub-)acute stroke,"Stroke remains a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, placing a
heavy socioeconomic burden. Over the past decade, advances in endovascular
reperfusion therapy and the use of CT and MRI imaging for treatment guidance
have significantly improved patient outcomes and are now standard in clinical
practice. To develop machine learning algorithms that can extract meaningful
and reproducible models of brain function for both clinical and research
purposes from stroke images - particularly for lesion identification, brain
health quantification, and prognosis - large, diverse, and well-annotated
public datasets are essential. While only a few datasets with (sub-)acute
stroke data were previously available, several large, high-quality datasets

Development of a Deep Learning Method to Identify Acute Ischemic Stroke Lesions on Brain CT,"Computed Tomography (CT) is commonly used to image acute ischemic stroke
(AIS) patients, but its interpretation by radiologists is time-consuming and
subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning (DL) techniques can
provide automated CT brain scan assessment, but usually require annotated
images. Aiming to develop a DL method for AIS using labelled but not annotated
CT brain scans from patients with AIS, we designed a convolutional neural
network-based DL algorithm using routinely-collected CT brain scans from the
Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3), which were not acquired using strict
research protocols. The DL model aimed to detect AIS lesions and classify the
side of the brain affected. We explored the impact of AIS lesion features,
background brain appearances, and timing on DL performance. From 5772 unique CT
scans of 2347 AIS patients (median age 82), 54% had visible AIS lesions
according to expert labelling. Our best-performing DL method achieved 72%
accuracy for lesion presence and side. Lesions that were larger (80% accuracy)
or multiple (87% accuracy for two lesions, 100% for three or more), were better
detected. Follow-up scans had 76% accuracy, while baseline scans 67% accuracy.
Chronic brain conditions reduced accuracy, particularly non-stroke lesions and
old stroke lesions (32% and 31% error rates respectively). DL methods can be
designed for AIS lesion detection on CT using the vast quantities of
routinely-collected CT brain scan data. Ultimately, this should lead to more
robust and widely-applicable methods.","Alessandro Fontanella, Wenwen Li, Grant Mair, Antreas Antoniou, Eleanor Platt, Paul Armitage, Emanuele Trucco, Joanna Wardlaw, Amos Storkey",2023-09-29,,arXiv
3-Dimensional Deep Learning with Spatial Erasing for Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation in Brain MRI,"Purpose. Brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) are essential for the
diagnosis of neurological diseases. Recently, deep learning methods for
unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) have been proposed for the analysis of
brain MRI. These methods rely on healthy brain MRIs and eliminate the
requirement of pixel-wise annotated data compared to supervised deep learning.
While a wide range of methods for UAD have been proposed, these methods are
mostly 2D and only learn from MRI slices, disregarding that brain lesions are
inherently 3D and the spatial context of MRI volumes remains unexploited.
  Methods. We investigate whether using increased spatial context by using MRI
volumes combined with spatial erasing leads to improved unsupervised anomaly
segmentation performance compared to learning from slices. We evaluate and
compare 2D variational autoencoder (VAE) to their 3D counterpart, propose 3D
input erasing, and systemically study the impact of the data set size on the
performance.
  Results. Using two publicly available segmentation data sets for evaluation,
3D VAE outperform their 2D counterpart, highlighting the advantage of
volumetric context. Also, our 3D erasing methods allow for further performance
improvements. Our best performing 3D VAE with input erasing leads to an average
DICE score of 31.40% compared to 25.76% for the 2D VAE.
  Conclusions. We propose 3D deep learning methods for UAD in brain MRI
combined with 3D erasing and demonstrate that 3D methods clearly outperform

Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in 3D Brain MRI using Deep Learning with Multi-Task Brain Age Prediction,"Lesion detection in brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) remains a
challenging task. MRIs are typically read and interpreted by domain experts,
which is a tedious and time-consuming process. Recently, unsupervised anomaly
detection (UAD) in brain MRI with deep learning has shown promising results to
provide a quick, initial assessment. So far, these methods only rely on the
visual appearance of healthy brain anatomy for anomaly detection. Another
biomarker for abnormal brain development is the deviation between the brain age
and the chronological age, which is unexplored in combination with UAD. We
propose deep learning for UAD in 3D brain MRI considering additional age
information. We analyze the value of age information during training, as an
additional anomaly score, and systematically study several architecture
concepts. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel deep learning approach for
UAD with multi-task age prediction. We use clinical T1-weighted MRIs of 1735
healthy subjects and the publicly available BraTs 2019 data set for our study.
Our novel approach significantly improves UAD performance with an AUC of 92.60%
compared to an AUC-score of 84.37% using previous approaches without age
information.","Marcel Bengs, Finn Behrendt, Max-Heinrich Laves, Julia Krüger, Roland Opfer, Alexander Schlaefer",2022-01-31,,arXiv
Unsupervised Detection of Lesions in Brain MRI using constrained adversarial auto-encoders,"Lesion detection in brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) remains a
challenging task. State-of-the-art approaches are mostly based on supervised
learning making use of large annotated datasets. Human beings, on the other
hand, even non-experts, can detect most abnormal lesions after seeing a handful
of healthy brain images. Replicating this capability of using prior information
on the appearance of healthy brain structure to detect lesions can help
computers achieve human level abnormality detection, specifically reducing the
need for numerous labeled examples and bettering generalization of previously
unseen lesions. To this end, we study detection of lesion regions in an
unsupervised manner by learning data distribution of brain MRI of healthy
subjects using auto-encoder based methods. We hypothesize that one of the main
limitations of the current models is the lack of consistency in latent
representation. We propose a simple yet effective constraint that helps mapping
of an image bearing lesion close to its corresponding healthy image in the
latent space. We use the Human Connectome Project dataset to learn distribution
of healthy-appearing brain MRI and report improved detection, in terms of AUC,
of the lesions in the BRATS challenge dataset.","Xiaoran Chen, Ender Konukoglu",2018-06-13,,arXiv
Ensembling Low Precision Models for Binary Biomedical Image Segmentation,"Segmentation of anatomical regions of interest such as vessels or small
lesions in medical images is still a difficult problem that is often tackled
with manual input by an expert. One of the major challenges for this task is
that the appearance of foreground (positive) regions can be similar to
background (negative) regions. As a result, many automatic segmentation
algorithms tend to exhibit asymmetric errors, typically producing more false
positives than false negatives. In this paper, we aim to leverage this
asymmetry and train a diverse ensemble of models with very high recall, while
sacrificing their precision. Our core idea is straightforward: A diverse
ensemble of low precision and high recall models are likely to make different
false positive errors (classifying background as foreground in different parts
of the image), but the true positives will tend to be consistent. Thus, in
aggregate the false positive errors will cancel out, yielding high performance
for the ensemble. Our strategy is general and can be applied with any
segmentation model. In three different applications (carotid artery
segmentation in a neck CT angiography, myocardium segmentation in a
cardiovascular MRI and multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation in a brain MRI),
we show how the proposed approach can significantly boost the performance of a
baseline segmentation method.","Tianyu Ma, Hang Zhang, Hanley Ong, Amar Vora, Thanh D. Nguyen, Ajay Gupta, Yi Wang, Mert Sabuncu",2020-10-16,10.1109/WACV48630.2021.00037,arXiv
Artificial Intelligence in Glioma Imaging: Challenges and Advances,"Primary brain tumors including gliomas continue to pose significant
management challenges to clinicians. While the presentation, the pathology, and
the clinical course of these lesions are variable, the initial investigations
are usually similar. Patients who are suspected to have a brain tumor will be
assessed with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The imaging findings are used by neurosurgeons to determine the feasibility of
surgical resection and plan such an undertaking. Imaging studies are also an
indispensable tool in tracking tumor progression or its response to treatment.
As these imaging studies are non-invasive, relatively cheap and accessible to
patients, there have been many efforts over the past two decades to increase
the amount of clinically-relevant information that can be extracted from brain
imaging. Most recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been
employed to segment and characterize brain tumors, as well as to detect
progression or treatment-response. However, the clinical utility of such
endeavours remains limited due to challenges in data collection and annotation,
model training, and the reliability of AI-generated information.
  We provide a review of recent advances in addressing the above challenges.
First, to overcome the challenge of data paucity, different image imputation
and synthesis techniques along with annotation collection efforts are
summarized. Next, various training strategies are presented to meet multiple
desiderata, such as model performance, generalization ability, data privacy
protection, and learning with sparse annotations. Finally, standardized
performance evaluation and model interpretability methods have been reviewed.

Patched Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRI,"The use of supervised deep learning techniques to detect pathologies in brain
MRI scans can be challenging due to the diversity of brain anatomy and the need
for annotated data sets. An alternative approach is to use unsupervised anomaly
detection, which only requires sample-level labels of healthy brains to create
a reference representation. This reference representation can then be compared
to unhealthy brain anatomy in a pixel-wise manner to identify abnormalities. To
accomplish this, generative models are needed to create anatomically consistent
MRI scans of healthy brains. While recent diffusion models have shown promise
in this task, accurately generating the complex structure of the human brain
remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a method that reformulates the
generation task of diffusion models as a patch-based estimation of healthy
brain anatomy, using spatial context to guide and improve reconstruction. We
evaluate our approach on data of tumors and multiple sclerosis lesions and
demonstrate a relative improvement of 25.1% compared to existing baselines.","Finn Behrendt, Debayan Bhattacharya, Julia Krüger, Roland Opfer, Alexander Schlaefer",2023-03-07,,arXiv
Temporally Adjustable Longitudinal Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery MRI Estimation / Synthesis for Multiple Sclerosis,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive neurological disease
characterized by the development of lesions in the white matter of the brain.
T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) provides superior visualization and characterization of MS lesions,
relative to other MRI modalities. Longitudinal brain FLAIR MRI in MS, involving
repetitively imaging a patient over time, provides helpful information for
clinicians towards monitoring disease progression. Predicting future whole
brain MRI examinations with variable time lag has only been attempted in
limited applications, such as healthy aging and structural degeneration in
Alzheimer's Disease. In this article, we present novel modifications to deep
learning architectures for MS FLAIR image synthesis, in order to support
prediction of longitudinal images in a flexible continuous way. This is
achieved with learned transposed convolutions, which support modelling time as
a spatially distributed array with variable temporal properties at different
spatial locations. Thus, this approach can theoretically model
spatially-specific time-dependent brain development, supporting the modelling
of more rapid growth at appropriate physical locations, such as the site of an
MS brain lesion. This approach also supports the clinician user to define how
far into the future a predicted examination should target. Accurate prediction
of future rounds of imaging can inform clinicians of potentially poor patient
outcomes, which may be able to contribute to earlier treatment and better
prognoses. Four distinct deep learning architectures have been developed. The
ISBI2015 longitudinal MS dataset was used to validate and compare our proposed
approaches. Results demonstrate that a modified ACGAN achieves the best
performance and reduces variability in model accuracy.","Jueqi Wang, Derek Berger, Erin Mazerolle, Othman Soufan, Jacob Levman",2022-09-09,,arXiv
Scale-Space Autoencoders for Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation in Brain MRI,"Brain pathologies can vary greatly in size and shape, ranging from few pixels

Autoencoder-based methods for unsupervised anomaly segmentation in brain MRI
have shown promising performance, but face difficulties in modeling
distributions with high fidelity, which is crucial for accurate delineation of
particularly small lesions. Here, similar to these previous works, we model the
distribution of healthy brain MRI to localize pathologies from erroneous
reconstructions. However, to achieve improved reconstruction fidelity at higher
resolutions, we learn to compress and reconstruct different frequency bands of
healthy brain MRI using the laplacian pyramid. In a range of experiments
comparing our method to different State-of-the-Art approaches on three
different brain MR datasets with MS lesions and tumors, we show improved
anomaly segmentation performance and the general capability to obtain much more
crisp reconstructions of input data at native resolution. The modeling of the
laplacian pyramid further enables the delineation and aggregation of lesions at
multiple scales, which allows to effectively cope with different pathologies
and lesion sizes using a single model.","Christoph Baur, Benedikt Wiestler, Shadi Albarqouni, Nassir Navab",2020-06-23,,arXiv
The role of noise in denoising models for anomaly detection in medical images,"Pathological brain lesions exhibit diverse appearance in brain images, in
terms of intensity, texture, shape, size, and location. Comprehensive sets of
data and annotations are difficult to acquire. Therefore, unsupervised anomaly
detection approaches have been proposed using only normal data for training,
with the aim of detecting outlier anomalous voxels at test time. Denoising
methods, for instance classical denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and more recently
emerging diffusion models, are a promising approach, however naive application
of pixelwise noise leads to poor anomaly detection performance. We show that
optimization of the spatial resolution and magnitude of the noise improves the
performance of different model training regimes, with similar noise parameter
adjustments giving good performance for both DAEs and diffusion models. Visual
inspection of the reconstructions suggests that the training noise influences
the trade-off between the extent of the detail that is reconstructed and the
extent of erasure of anomalies, both of which contribute to better anomaly
detection performance. We validate our findings on two real-world datasets
(tumor detection in brain MRI and hemorrhage/ischemia/tumor detection in brain
CT), showing good detection on diverse anomaly appearances. Overall, we find
that a DAE trained with coarse noise is a fast and simple method that gives
state-of-the-art accuracy. Diffusion models applied to anomaly detection are as
yet in their infancy and provide a promising avenue for further research.","Antanas Kascenas, Pedro Sanchez, Patrick Schrempf, Chaoyang Wang, William Clackett, Shadia S. Mikhael, Jeremy P.

Mixed-UNet: Refined Class Activation Mapping for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Multi-scale Inference,"Deep learning techniques have shown great potential in medical image
processing, particularly through accurate and reliable image segmentation on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or computed tomography (CT) scans, which
allow the localization and diagnosis of lesions. However, training these
segmentation models requires a large number of manually annotated pixel-level
labels, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, in contrast to
image-level labels that are easier to obtain. It is imperative to resolve this
problem through weakly-supervised semantic segmentation models using
image-level labels as supervision since it can significantly reduce human
annotation efforts. Most of the advanced solutions exploit class activation
mapping (CAM). However, the original CAMs rarely capture the precise boundaries
of lesions. In this study, we propose the strategy of multi-scale inference to
refine CAMs by reducing the detail loss in single-scale reasoning. For
segmentation, we develop a novel model named Mixed-UNet, which has two parallel
branches in the decoding phase. The results can be obtained after fusing the
extracted features from two branches. We evaluate the designed Mixed-UNet
against several prevalent deep learning-based segmentation approaches on our
dataset collected from the local hospital and public datasets. The validation
results demonstrate that our model surpasses available methods under the same
supervision level in the segmentation of various lesions from brain imaging.","Yang Liu, Ersi Zhang, Lulu Xu, Chufan Xiao, Xiaoyun Zhong, Lijin Lian, Fang Li, Bin Jiang, Yuhan Dong, Lan Ma, Qiming Huang, Ming Xu, Yongbing Zhang, Dongmei Yu, Chenggang Yan, Peiwu Qin",2022-05-06,,arXiv

View-Disentangled Transformer for Brain Lesion Detection,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely adopted in brain lesion

more accurate tumour detection. First, the proposed transformer harvests
long-range correlation among different positions in a 3D brain scan. Second,
the transformer models a stack of slice features as multiple 2D views and
enhance these features view-by-view, which approximately achieves the 3D
correlation computing in an efficient way. Third, we deploy the proposed
transformer module in a transformer backbone, which can effectively detect the
2D regions surrounding brain lesions. The experimental results show that our
proposed view-disentangled transformer performs well for brain lesion detection

Subject-Specific Lesion Generation and Pseudo-Healthy Synthesis for Multiple Sclerosis Brain Images,"Understanding the intensity characteristics of brain lesions is key for

Prior Attention Network for Multi-Lesion Segmentation in Medical Images,"The accurate segmentation of multiple types of lesions from adjacent tissues
in medical images is significant in clinical practice. Convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) based on the coarse-to-fine strategy have been widely used in
this field. However, multi-lesion segmentation remains to be challenging due to
the uncertainty in size, contrast, and high interclass similarity of tissues.
In addition, the commonly adopted cascaded strategy is rather demanding in
terms of hardware, which limits the potential of clinical deployment. To
address the problems above,we propose a novel Prior Attention Network (PANet)
that follows the coarse-to-fine strategy to perform multi-lesion segmentation
in medical images. The proposed network achieves the two steps of segmentation
in a single network by inserting lesion-related spatial attention mechanism in
the network. Further, we also propose the intermediate supervision strategy for
generating lesion-related attention to acquire the regions of interest (ROIs),
which accelerates the convergence and obviously improves the segmentation
performance. We have investigated the proposed segmentation framework in two
applications: 2D segmentation of multiple lung infections in lung CT slices and
3D segmentation of multiple lesions in brain MRIs. Experimental results show
that in both 2D and 3D segmentation tasks our proposed network achieves better
performance with less computational cost compared with cascaded networks. The
proposed network can be regarded as a universal solution to multi-lesion
segmentation in both 2D and 3D tasks. The source code is available at:

UNet#: A UNet-like Redesigning Skip Connections for Medical Image Segmentation,"As an essential prerequisite for developing a medical intelligent assistant
system, medical image segmentation has received extensive research and
concentration from the neural network community. A series of UNet-like networks
with encoder-decoder architecture has achieved extraordinary success, in which
UNet2+ and UNet3+ redesign skip connections, respectively proposing dense skip
connection and full-scale skip connection and dramatically improving compared
with UNet in medical image segmentation. However, UNet2+ lacks sufficient
information explored from the full scale, which will affect the learning of
organs' location and boundary. Although UNet3+ can obtain the full-scale
aggregation feature map, owing to the small number of neurons in the structure,
it does not satisfy the segmentation of tiny objects when the number of samples
is small. This paper proposes a novel network structure combining dense skip
connections and full-scale skip connections, named UNet-sharp (UNet\#) for its
shape similar to symbol \#. The proposed UNet\# can aggregate feature maps of
different scales in the decoder sub-network and capture fine-grained details
and coarse-grained semantics from the full scale, which benefits learning the
exact location and accurately segmenting the boundary of organs or lesions. We
perform deep supervision for model pruning to speed up testing and make it
possible for the model to run on mobile devices; furthermore, designing two
classification-guided modules to reduce false positives achieves more accurate
segmentation results. Various experiments of semantic segmentation and instance
segmentation on different modalities (EM, CT, MRI) and dimensions (2D, 3D)

the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.","Ledan Qian, Xiao Zhou, Yi Li, Zhongyi Hu",2022-05-24,,arXiv

Leveraging 3D Information in Unsupervised Brain MRI Segmentation,"Automatic segmentation of brain abnormalities is challenging, as they vary

propose to perform UAD in a 3D fashion and compare 2D and 3D VAEs. As a side

Discrepancy-based Diffusion Models for Lesion Detection in Brain MRI,"Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have exhibited significant
effectiveness in computer vision tasks, particularly in image generation.
However, their notable performance heavily relies on labelled datasets, which
limits their application in medical images due to the associated high-cost
annotations. Current DPM-related methods for lesion detection in medical
imaging, which can be categorized into two distinct approaches, primarily rely
on image-level annotations. The first approach, based on anomaly detection,
involves learning reference healthy brain representations and identifying
anomalies based on the difference in inference results. In contrast, the second
approach, resembling a segmentation task, employs only the original brain
multi-modalities as prior information for generating pixel-level annotations.
In this paper, our proposed model - discrepancy distribution medical diffusion
(DDMD) - for lesion detection in brain MRI introduces a novel framework by
incorporating distinctive discrepancy features, deviating from the conventional
direct reliance on image-level annotations or the original brain modalities. In
our method, the inconsistency in image-level annotations is translated into
distribution discrepancies among heterogeneous samples while preserving
information within homogeneous samples. This property retains pixel-wise
uncertainty and facilitates an implicit ensemble of segmentation, ultimately
enhancing the overall detection performance. Thorough experiments conducted on

Feasibility of Federated Learning from Client Databases with Different Brain Diseases and MRI Modalities,"Segmentation models for brain lesions in MRI are typically developed for a
specific disease and trained on data with a predefined set of MRI modalities.
Such models cannot segment the disease using data with a different set of MRI
modalities, nor can they segment other types of diseases. Moreover, this
training paradigm prevents a model from using the advantages of learning from
heterogeneous databases that may contain scans and segmentation labels for
different brain pathologies and diverse sets of MRI modalities. Additionally,
the confidentiality of patient data often prevents central data aggregation,
necessitating a decentralized approach. Is it feasible to use Federated
Learning (FL) to train a single model on client databases that contain scans
and labels of different brain pathologies and diverse sets of MRI modalities?
We demonstrate promising results by combining appropriate, simple, and
practical modifications to the model and training strategy: Designing a model
with input channels that cover the whole set of modalities available across
clients, training with random modality drop, and exploring the effects of
feature normalization methods. Evaluation on 7 brain MRI databases with 5
different diseases shows that this FL framework can train a single model
achieving very promising results in segmenting all disease types seen during
training. Importantly, it can segment these diseases in new databases that
contain sets of modalities different from those in training clients. These
results demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility and effectiveness of
using FL to train a single 3D segmentation model on decentralised data with
diverse brain diseases and MRI modalities, a necessary step towards leveraging
heterogeneous real-world databases. Code:

Fast Unsupervised Brain Anomaly Detection and Segmentation with Diffusion Models,"Deep generative models have emerged as promising tools for detecting

performance for anomaly detection in medical imaging. Nonetheless, these models

the significant inference times associated with transformers. Denoising

Diffusion models can be applied to the latent representations learnt by
autoencoders, making them easily scalable and great candidates for application
to high dimensional data, such as medical images. Here, we propose a method

training the models on healthy data and then exploring its diffusion and
reverse steps across its Markov chain, we can identify anomalous areas in the

quality is compromised by signal inhomogeneities, non-isotropic voxel
resolutions, or the presence of brain lesions that are located near (or
involve) the outer regions of the brain and the meninges. In addition, SAM has
also unsurpassed segmentation properties allowing a fine grain separation of

Change in structural brain network abnormalities after traumatic brain injury determines post-injury recovery,"The trajectory of an individual's recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI)
is heterogeneous, with complete recovery in some cases but persistent
disability in others. We hypothesized that changes in structural brain network
abnormalities guide the trajectory of an individual's recovery post-injury. Our
objective was to characterize the variability in recovery post-TBI by
identifying a putative neuroimaging biomarker of traumatic axonal injury (TAI)
in individuals with mild TBI.
  We analyzed 70 T1-weighted and diffusion MRIs longitudinally collected from
35 individuals during the subacute and chronic post-injury periods. Each
individual underwent longitudinal blood work to characterize blood protein
biomarkers of axonal and glial injury and assessment of post-injury recovery in
the subacute and chronic periods. By comparing the MRI data of individual cases
with 35 controls, we estimated the longitudinal change in structural brain
network abnormalities. We validated this proxy measure of TAI with independent
measures of acute intracranial injury estimated from head CT and blood protein
biomarkers.
  Post-injury structural network abnormality was significantly higher than
controls in both subacute and chronic periods, associated with an acute CT
lesion and subacute blood levels of glial fibrillary acid protein (r=0.5,
p=0.008) and neurofilament light (r=0.41, p=0.02). Longitudinal change in
abnormality associated with change in functional outcome status (r=-0.51,
p=0.003) and post-concussive symptoms (BSI: r=0.46, p=0.03; RPQ:r = 0.46,

corresponded to structural network hubs or areas susceptible to neurotrauma.
  Structural network abnormalities might be a biomarker of TAI. Assessing
changes in brain network abnormality might enable better patient stratification

A Contrast-Adaptive Method for Simultaneous Whole-Brain and Lesion Segmentation in Multiple Sclerosis,"Here we present a method for the simultaneous segmentation of white matter
lesions and normal-appearing neuroanatomical structures from multi-contrast
brain MRI scans of multiple sclerosis patients. The method integrates a novel
model for white matter lesions into a previously validated generative model for
whole-brain segmentation. By using separate models for the shape of anatomical
structures and their appearance in MRI, the algorithm can adapt to data
acquired with different scanners and imaging protocols without retraining. We
validate the method using four disparate datasets, showing robust performance
in white matter lesion segmentation while simultaneously segmenting dozens of
other brain structures. We further demonstrate that the contrast-adaptive
method can also be safely applied to MRI scans of healthy controls, and
replicate previously documented atrophy patterns in deep gray matter structures
in MS. The algorithm is publicly available as part of the open-source
neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.","Stefano Cerri, Oula Puonti, Dominik S. Meier, Jens Wuerfel, Mark Mühlau, Hartwig R. Siebner, Koen Van Leemput",2020-05-11,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117471,arXiv
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in 3D Brain MRI using Deep Learning with impured training data,"The detection of lesions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-scans of human
brains remains challenging, time-consuming and error-prone. Recently,
unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods have shown promising results for
this task. These methods rely on training data sets that solely contain healthy
samples. Compared to supervised approaches, this significantly reduces the need
for an extensive amount of labeled training data. However, data labelling
remains error-prone. We study how unhealthy samples within the training data
affect anomaly detection performance for brain MRI-scans. For our evaluations,
we consider three publicly available data sets and use autoencoders (AE) as a
well-established baseline method for UAD. We systematically evaluate the effect
of impured training data by injecting different quantities of unhealthy samples
to our training set of healthy samples from T1-weighted MRI-scans. We evaluate
a method to identify falsely labeled samples directly during training based on
the reconstruction error of the AE. Our results show that training with impured
data decreases the UAD performance notably even with few falsely labeled
samples. By performing outlier removal directly during training based on the
reconstruction-loss, we demonstrate that falsely labeled data can be detected
and removed to mitigate the effect of falsely labeled data. Overall, we
highlight the importance of clean data sets for UAD in brain MRI and
demonstrate an approach for detecting falsely labeled data directly during
training.","Finn Behrendt, Marcel Bengs, Frederik Rogge, Julia Krüger, Roland Opfer, Alexander Schlaefer",2022-04-12,,arXiv
Structure Regularized Attentive Network for Automatic Femoral Head Necrosis Diagnosis and Localization,"In recent years, several works have adopted the convolutional neural network
(CNN) to diagnose the avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH) based on
X-ray images or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, due to the tissue
overlap, X-ray images are difficult to provide fine-grained features for early
diagnosis. MRI, on the other hand, has a long imaging time, is more expensive,
making it impractical in mass screening. Computed tomography (CT) shows
layer-wise tissues, is faster to image, and is less costly than MRI. However,
to our knowledge, there is no work on CT-based automated diagnosis of AVNFH. In
this work, we collected and labeled a large-scale dataset for AVNFH ranking. In
addition, existing end-to-end CNNs only yields the classification result and
are difficult to provide more information for doctors in diagnosis. To address
this issue, we propose the structure regularized attentive network (SRANet),
which is able to highlight the necrotic regions during classification based on
patch attention. SRANet extracts features in chunks of images, obtains weight
via the attention mechanism to aggregate the features, and constrains them by a
structural regularizer with prior knowledge to improve the generalization.
SRANet was evaluated on our AVNFH-CT dataset. Experimental results show that
SRANet is superior to CNNs for AVNFH classification, moreover, it can localize
lesions and provide more information to assist doctors in diagnosis. Our codes
are made public at https://github.com/tomas-lilingfeng/SRANet.","Lingfeng Li, Huaiwei Cong, Gangming Zhao, Junran Peng, Zheng Zhang, Jinpeng Li",2022-08-23,,arXiv
SegBook: A Simple Baseline and Cookbook for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation,"Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most popular modalities for medical
imaging. By far, CT images have contributed to the largest publicly available
datasets for volumetric medical segmentation tasks, covering full-body
anatomical structures. Large amounts of full-body CT images provide the
opportunity to pre-train powerful models, e.g., STU-Net pre-trained in a
supervised fashion, to segment numerous anatomical structures. However, it
remains unclear in which conditions these pre-trained models can be transferred
to various downstream medical segmentation tasks, particularly segmenting the
other modalities and diverse targets. To address this problem, a large-scale
benchmark for comprehensive evaluation is crucial for finding these conditions.
Thus, we collected 87 public datasets varying in modality, target, and sample
size to evaluate the transfer ability of full-body CT pre-trained models. We
then employed a representative model, STU-Net with multiple model scales, to
conduct transfer learning across modalities and targets. Our experimental
results show that (1) there may be a bottleneck effect concerning the dataset
size in fine-tuning, with more improvement on both small- and large-scale
datasets than medium-size ones. (2) Models pre-trained on full-body CT
demonstrate effective modality transfer, adapting well to other modalities such
as MRI. (3) Pre-training on the full-body CT not only supports strong
performance in structure detection but also shows efficacy in lesion detection,
showcasing adaptability across target tasks. We hope that this large-scale open
evaluation of transfer learning can direct future research in volumetric
medical image segmentation.","Jin Ye, Ying Chen, Yanjun Li, Haoyu Wang, Zhongying Deng, Ziyan Huang, Yanzhou Su, Chenglong Ma, Yuanfeng Ji, Junjun He",2024-11-21,,arXiv
Stationary CT Imaging of Intracranial Hemorrhage with Diffusion Posterior Sampling Reconstruction,"Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) can be used in Computed Tomography (CT)
reconstruction by leveraging diffusion-based generative models for
unconditional image synthesis while matching the observations (data) of a CT
scan. Of particular interest is its application in scenarios involving sparse
or limited angular sampling, where conventional reconstruction algorithms are
often insufficient. We developed a DPS algorithm for 3D reconstruction from a
stationary CT (sCT) portable brain stroke imaging unit based on a multi-x-ray
source array (MXA) of 31 x-ray tubes and a curved area detector. In this
configuration, conventional reconstruction e.g., Penalized Weighted Least
Squares (PWLS) with a Huber edge-preserving penalty, suffers from severe
directional undersampling artifacts. The proposed DPS integrates a
two-dimensional diffusion model, acting on image slices, coupled to sCT data
consistency and volumetric regularization terms to enable 3D reconstruction
robust to noise and incomplete sampling. To reduce the computational burden of
DPS, stochastic contraction with PWLS initialization was used to decrease the
number of diffusion steps. The validation studies involved simulations of
anthropomorphic brain phantoms with synthetic bleeds and experimental data from
an sCT bench. In simulations, DPS achieved ~130% reduction of directional
artifacts compared to PWLS and 30% better recovery of lesion shape (DICE
coefficient). Benchtop studies demonstrated enhanced visualization of brain
features in a Kyoto Kagaku head phantom. The proposed DPS achieved improved
visualization of intracranial hemorrhage and brain morphology compared to
conventional model-based reconstruction for the highly undersampled sCT system.","Alejandro Lopez-Montes, Thomas McSkimming, Anthony Skeats, Chris Delnooz, Brian Gonzales, Wojciech Zbijewski, Alejandro Sisniega",2024-07-15,,arXiv
Automated neuroradiological support systems for multiple cerebrovascular disease markers -- A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) can lead to stroke and dementia. Stroke is the
second leading cause of death world wide and dementia incidence is increasing
by the year. There are several markers of CVD that are visible on brain
imaging, including: white matter hyperintensities (WMH), acute and chronic
ischaemic stroke lesions (ISL), lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS),
acute and chronic haemorrhagic lesions, and cerebral microbleeds (CMB). Brain
atrophy also occurs in CVD. These markers are important for patient management
and intervention, since they indicate elevated risk of future stroke and
dementia. We systematically reviewed automated systems designed to support
radiologists reporting on these CVD imaging findings. We considered
commercially available software and research publications which identify at
least two CVD markers. In total, we included 29 commercial products and 13
research publications. Two distinct types of commercial support system were
available: those which identify acute stroke lesions (haemorrhagic and
ischaemic) from computed tomography (CT) scans, mainly for the purpose of
patient triage; and those which measure WMH and atrophy regionally and
longitudinally. In research, WMH and ISL were the markers most frequently
analysed together, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans; lacunes and PVS
were each targeted only twice and CMB only once. For stroke, commercially
available systems largely support the emergency setting, whilst research
systems consider also follow-up and routine scans. The systems to quantify WMH
and atrophy are focused on neurodegenerative disease support, where these CVD
markers are also of significance. There are currently no openly validated
systems, commercially, or in research, performing a comprehensive joint
analysis of all CVD markers (WMH, ISL, lacunes, PVS, haemorrhagic lesions, CMB,
and atrophy).","Jesse Phitidis, Alison Q. O'Neil, William N. Whiteley, Beatrice Alex, Joanna M. Wardlaw, Miguel O. Bernabeu, Maria Valdés Hernández",2024-10-22,,arXiv
ACAT: Adversarial Counterfactual Attention for Classification and Detection in Medical Imaging,"In some medical imaging tasks and other settings where only small parts of
the image are informative for the classification task, traditional CNNs can
sometimes struggle to generalise. Manually annotated Regions of Interest (ROI)
are sometimes used to isolate the most informative parts of the image. However,
these are expensive to collect and may vary significantly across annotators. To
overcome these issues, we propose a framework that employs saliency maps to
obtain soft spatial attention masks that modulate the image features at
different scales. We refer to our method as Adversarial Counterfactual
Attention (ACAT). ACAT increases the baseline classification accuracy of
lesions in brain CT scans from 71.39% to 72.55% and of COVID-19 related
findings in lung CT scans from 67.71% to 70.84% and exceeds the performance of
competing methods. We investigate the best way to generate the saliency maps
employed in our architecture and propose a way to obtain them from
adversarially generated counterfactual images. They are able to isolate the
area of interest in brain and lung CT scans without using any manual
annotations. In the task of localising the lesion location out of 6 possible
regions, they obtain a score of 65.05% on brain CT scans, improving the score
of 61.29% obtained with the best competing method.","Alessandro Fontanella, Antreas Antoniou, Wenwen Li, Joanna Wardlaw, Grant Mair, Emanuele Trucco, Amos Storkey",2023-03-27,,arXiv
Transfer Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation,"Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors that are treated with
chemoradiotherapy and surgery. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used by
radiotherapists to manually segment brain lesions and to observe their
development throughout the therapy. The manual image segmentation process is
time-consuming and results tend to vary among different human raters.
Therefore, there is a substantial demand for automatic image segmentation
algorithms that produce a reliable and accurate segmentation of various brain
tissue types. Recent advances in deep learning have led to convolutional neural
network architectures that excel at various visual recognition tasks. They have
been successfully applied to the medical context including medical image
segmentation. In particular, fully convolutional networks (FCNs) such as the
U-Net produce state-of-the-art results in the automatic segmentation of brain
tumors. MRI brain scans are volumetric and exist in various co-registered
modalities that serve as input channels for these FCN architectures. Training
algorithms for brain tumor segmentation on this complex input requires large
amounts of computational resources and is prone to overfitting. In this work,
we construct FCNs with pretrained convolutional encoders. We show that we can
stabilize the training process this way and achieve an improvement with respect
to dice scores and Hausdorff distances. We also test our method on a privately
obtained clinical dataset.","Jonas Wacker, Marcelo Ladeira, José Eduardo Vaz Nascimento",2019-12-28,,arXiv
Skull-stripping for Tumor-bearing Brain Images,"Skull-stripping separates the skull region of the head from the soft brain
tissues. In many cases of brain image analysis, this is an essential
preprocessing step in order to improve the final result. This is true for both
registration and segmentation tasks. In fact, skull-stripping of magnetic
resonance images (MRI) is a well-studied problem with numerous publications in
recent years. Many different algorithms have been proposed, a summary and
comparison of which can be found in [Fennema-Notestine, 2006]. Despite the
abundance of approaches, we discovered that the algorithms which had been
suggested so far, perform poorly when dealing with tumor-bearing brain images.
This is mostly due to additional difficulties in separating the brain from the
skull in this case, especially when the lesion is located very close to the
skull border. Additionally, images acquired according to standard clinical
protocols, often exhibit anisotropic resolution and only partial coverage,
which further complicates the task. Therefore, we developed a method which is
dedicated to skull-stripping for clinically acquired tumor-bearing brain
images.","Stefan Bauer, Lutz-P. Nolte, Mauricio Reyes",2012-04-02,,arXiv
