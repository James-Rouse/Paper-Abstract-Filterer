[Rapidly progressive dementia by late neurosyphilis (general paresis). Case report].,"The term rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) describes a disorder with rapid progression which leads to a major cognitive decline in less than 1 or 2 years. Neurosyphilis is an infectious cause of RPD and it is classified clinically into early and late forms. The latter affect the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. The objective of this report is to present a case of RPD caused by neurosyphilis. 55-year-old man, with no past medical history, who in July 2022 had a clinical presentation of aggressiveness, irritability, lability, difficulty in performing simple activities, amnesia, hallucinations, delusions, abulia, low responsiveness, all of which affected his independence and quality of life. Initially, it was treated as schizophrenia with no signs of improvement and clinical deterioration. When atypical data and rapid progression were evident at patient's consultation in January 2023, there was a suspicion of the presence of RPD, highlighting positive VDRL and IgM-IgG anti-Treponema pallidum antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed global cortical atrophy, predominantly frontal. Treatment with ceftriaxone was started for 14 days, with clinical improvement observed in the MOCA test from 13/30 to 23/30. The etiological identification of RPD is a clinical challenge due to the wide variety of causes, which is why it is important a specific diagnostic approach and a timely treatment in order to avoid the progression of potentially reversible causes.",39578093
The Importance of Primary Care Cognitive Evaluation in Detecting an Atypical Presentation of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.,"Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a syndrome that characteristically presents with progressive gait impairment, cognitive deficits, and urinary urgency or incontinence. We present a case of a 54-year-old male with a past medical history of alcohol use and no primary care provider with new-onset auditory hallucinations. The patient was found to have a marked enlargement of the supratentorial and infratentorial ventricles on both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an opening pressure of 21 on the lumbar puncture, concerning for NPH. Clinically, there were signs of cognitive impairment due to memory and cognitive function loss, but the patient lacked gait disturbances or incontinence. Although not common, NPH may present with auditory hallucinations or delusions, as seen with our patient. In this case report, we emphasize the importance of annual cognitive assessments in order to evaluate atypical psychiatric manifestations of neurological disorders. Because clinical symptoms are more likely to be reversible when recognized early in the clinical course and the progression of these symptoms can be prevented with the placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, it is of utmost importance to accurately recognize and diagnose NPH as early as possible. We also discuss the less commonly known markers of NPH on MRI.",38993469
Anti-LGI1 encephalitis preceded by psychiatric symptoms: A case report.,"To date, only a few reports of anti-LGI1 encephalitis with isolated psychiatric symptoms in the initial phase have been reported. We present a relatively rare case of antileucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis that developed only psychiatric symptoms at the onset. The patient was a male in his 40s who developed anxiety and panic symptoms and was started on antidepressants after being diagnosed with panic disorder by a psychiatrist. He visited our hospital 2 months later presenting with hallucinations, delusions, mild cognitive decline, and faciobrachial dystonic seizures in the left upper extremity and face. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging revealed swelling and hyperintensities in the right caudate nucleus and putamen. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis did not show increased protein levels or cell counts and revealed positive oligoclonal bands. Subsequently, positive results for anti-LGI1 antibodies were observed in the cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with anti-LGI1 encephalitis. This case highlights the need to consider anti-LGI1 encephalitis therapy in patients with acute-onset psychiatric symptoms.",38868479
Ictal Cotard delusion as a manifestation of nonconvulsive status epilepticus: A case report and commentary.,"Psychosis of epileptic origin can present a wide range of cognitive and affective symptoms and is often underrecognized. Usually occurring in the inter- and postictal phase, epileptic psychosis is mostly related to temporal lobe epilepsy. Here, we describe the clinical presentation and diagnostic workup including routine EEG recording and brain MRI of a 63-year-old woman expressing isolated nihilistic delusions comprising belief of being dead and denial of self-existence. EEG showed an ictal pattern fulfilling the Salzburg criteria of nonconvulsive status epilepticus and brain MRI revealed extensive peri-ictal hyperperfusion. Delusional symptoms and EEG abnormalities subsided after acute antiseizure treatment. Our case illustrates how nihilistic delusions can occur as a direct clinical correlate of seizure activity, thereby expanding the spectrum of ictal neuropsychiatric phenomena in temporal lobe epilepsy and highlighting the need to consider an epileptic origin in patients presenting with psychotic symptoms.",38686977
Case report: Periventricular heterotopia and early-onset bipolar disorder in adolescent patient with history of childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"Periventricular heterotopia (PH) is a developmental malformation in the brain. Because the clinical symptoms are heterogeneous, few studies have investigated the psychiatric symptoms associated with PH. We describe the case of a 17-year-old male with bipolar disorder (BD), who had been treated for attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and developmental delay in childhood. He had experienced depression for 1 year and was admitted to the emergency room following a suicide attempt. He was admitted to the psychiatric ward for further evaluation and treatment for elated mood, decreased need for sleep, increased sexuality, and delusion. The patient was diagnosed with BP-I disorder and PH via brain magnetic resonance imaging. After combined treatment with valproic acid and aripiprazole, his manic symptoms stabilized. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an adolescent PH case with a history of early onset BD and ADHD in childhood.",38283846
A rare case report of Huntington's disease with severe psychiatric symptoms as initial manifestations.,"Huntington's disease (HD) stands as an inherited and progressive neurodegenerative ailment distinguished by chorea-esque movement patterns, which manifest as archetypal symptoms. The presence of pronounced psychiatric onset symptoms in patients can considerably amplify the intricacies of accurate diagnosis. A 43-year-old gentleman was admitted with a five-year chronicle of delusions, hallucinations, and irritability. He had previously received a diagnosis of schizophrenia and had been subjected to a regimen of antipsychotic medications for a span exceeding four years. However, subsequent to the application of cerebral MRI and genetic testing, his condition was conclusively redetermined as HD. The salient attribute of this case resides in the deferred diagnosis of HD attributable to the presence of acute psychiatric initial symptoms, a scenario bearing noteworthy ramifications for disease oversight and prognostication. This instance warrants attentive scrutiny and discourse within the professional community.",38190229
Hashimoto Encephalopathy Presenting with Acute Psychosis and Inappropriate Secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone: A Rare Case Responding to Steroid Therapy.,"BACKGROUND Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is an autoimmune encephalopathy that can involve various symptoms including psychosis. Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) may be a complication in some neurological diseases. However, the simultaneous occurrence of subacute psychosis and SIADH as the manifestation of HE, observed in the present case, has rarely been reported. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man was hospitalized with a 4-month history of abnormal behaviors, including talkativeness, stopping consumption of coffee and cigarettes, hoarding garbage, and sleep disorders. On physical examination, increased and incoherent speech with flight of idea and delusion were observed. The Mini-Mental State Examination score was 28/30. Laboratory findings included hyponatremia due to SIADH and a positive result for anti-thyroid and anti-NH2 terminal of alpha-enolase antibodies. Cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed only elevation of IL-6. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable; however, (I-123)-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography showed extensive hyperperfusion involving the brainstem and bilateral frontal and medial temporal lobes. Electroencephalography showed generalized slow waves, but there were no epileptiform discharges. After 2 courses of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone, his symptoms improved. Based on the findings of clinical features and steroid responsiveness, he was diagnosed with HE. Oral prednisolone and antipsychotic drugs were decreased without a relapse and he was discharged to his home. CONCLUSIONS Although psychosis complicating SIADH is rare, HE should be considered in the differential diagnosis because of its treatment efficacy.",38085696
Case report: Psychosis and catatonia in an adolescent patient with adipsic hypernatremia and autoantibodies against the subfornical organ.,"This is the first description of a patient in which adipsic hypernatremia, a rare autoimmune encephalitis, presented in combination with complex psychiatric symptomatology, including psychosis and catatonia. Adipsic hypernatremia is characterized by autoantibodies against the thirst center of the brain. These autoantibodies cause inflammation and apoptosis in key regions of water homeostasis, leading to lack of thirst and highly increased serum sodium. To date, the symptoms of weakness, fatigue and drowsiness have been associated with adipsic hypernatremia, but no psychiatric symptomatology. Here, we showcase the first description of an adolescent patient, in which severe and complex psychiatric symptoms presented along with adipsic hypernatremia. The patient experienced delusion, hallucinations, restlessness and pronounced depression. Further, he showed ritualized, aggressive, disinhibited and sexualized behavior, as well as self-harm and psychomotor symptoms. Due to his severe condition, he was hospitalized on the emergency unit of the child and adolescent psychiatry for 8 months. Key symptoms of the presented clinical picture are: childhood-onset complex and treatment-resistant psychosis/catatonia, pronounced behavioral problems, fatigue, absent thirst perception, hypernatremia and elevated prolactin levels. This case report renders first evidence speaking for a causal link between the autoimmune adipsic hypernatremia and the psychotic disorder. Moreover, it sheds light on a new form of autoimmune psychosis.",37539324
"Cognitive, imaging, and psychiatric changes associated with chronic toluene use: case report and literature review.","Inhalant misuse and inhalant use disorder are global public health concern that impacts adolescents but can occur throughout life. Toluene is the most commonly misused inhalant. Toluene use leads to significant neuroanatomic, cognitive, and psychiatric deficits. The purpose of this study was to review and summarize the effects of toluene and present a case of a middle-aged patient with an inhalant use disorder. A literature review was conducted to evaluate imaging, neurocognitive, and psychiatric consequences of toluene misuse. The common imaging findings amongst those who misuse toluene were cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, ventricular dilation, loss of gray-white matter differentiation, corpus callosum thinning, and diffuse white matter changes. Concerning cognition, toluene misusers were shown to have deficits in intelligence, attention, memory, visuospatial function, and complex cognition. In addition, toluene users also commonly presented with apathy, flat affect, hallucinations, delusions, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The neuroanatomical, neurocognitive, and psychiatric effects of toluene misuse are profound. These deficits can make inhalant use disorder difficult to treat. Therefore, evidence-based treatments that recognize and address these domain-specific neurocognitive deficits are needed.",37503800
Case report: Evolution of catatonic mutism and psychotic symptoms in an adolescent with Down syndrome: transition from Down syndrome disintegrative disorder to anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.,"During her first year of junior high school, a 12-year-old Japanese girl with Down syndrome experienced dizziness, gait disruption, paroxysmal weakness in her hands, and sluggish speaking. Regular blood tests and a brain MRI revealed no abnormalities, and she was tentatively diagnosed with adjustment disorder. Nine months later, the patient experienced a subacute sickness of chest pain, nausea, sleep problem with night terrors, and delusion of observation. Rapid deterioration then developed with simultaneous fever, akinetic mutism, loss of facial expression, and urine incontinence. These catatonic symptoms improved after a few weeks after admission and treatment with lorazepam, escitalopram, and aripiprazole. After discharge, nonetheless, daytime slumber, empty eyes, paradoxical laughter, and declined verbal communication persisted. Upon confirmation of the cerebrospinal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoantibody, methylprednisolone pulse therapy was tried, but it had little effect. Visual hallucinations and cenesthopathy, as well as suicidal thoughts and delusions of death, have predominated in the following years. Cerebrospinal IL-1ra, IL-5, IL-15, CCL5, G-CSF, PDGFbb, and VFGF were raised in the early stage of initial medical attention with nonspecific complaints, but were less prominent in the later stages of catatonic mutism and psychotic symptoms. We suggest a disease concept of progression from Down syndrome disintegrative disorder to NMDA receptor encephalitis, based on this experience.",37360353
NOTCH2NLC mutation-positive neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease with retinal dystrophy: A case report and literature review.,"Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disorder that produces a broad spectrum of clinical conditions such as dementia, upper motor neuron involvement, extrapyramidal symptoms, and neuropathy. Some studies have reported ophthalmological conditions associated with the disease; however, the details of these conditions remain unclear. We report a 63-year-old Japanese female with cognitive decline, blurred vision, photophobia, and color blindness at 52 years of age who was diagnosed with cone dystrophy. She also had anxiety, insomnia, depression, delusions, hallucinations, a wide-based gait with short steps, and urinary incontinence. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse cerebral white matter changes and subcortical hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging. Skin biopsy showed p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in sweat glands. NOTCH2NLC gene analysis revealed abnormal GGC expansion; therefore, NIID was diagnosed. NOTCH2NLC mutation-positive NIID may be associated with retinal dystrophy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and skin biopsy are helpful diagnostic clues, and gene analysis is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.",37171294
Anti-Leucine-Rich Glioma-Inactivated 1 (Anti-LGI 1) Limbic Encephalitis and New-Onset Psychosis: A Case Report.,"Anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 limbic encephalitis (Anti-LGI 1 LE) is a subtype of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) and the most common cause of limbic encephalitis (LE). Clinically, it can have an acute to sub-acute onset of confusion and cognitive impairment, facial-brachial dystonic seizures (FDBS), and psychiatric disturbances. The clinical manifestations are varied, and its diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion to avoid delay in the treatment. When patients manifest mostly psychiatric symptoms, the disease may not be immediately recognized. We aim to report a case of Anti-LGI 1 LE in which the patient presented acute psychotic symptoms and was initially diagnosed with unspecified psychosis. We present a case of a patient with sub-acute behavioral changes, short-term memory loss, and insomnia who was brought to the emergency department after a sudden episode of disorganized behavior and speech. On medical examination, the patient presented persecutory delusions and indirect signs of auditory hallucinations. An initial diagnosis of unspecified psychosis was performed. Investigations revealed right temporal epileptiform activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG), abnormal bilateral hyperintensities in the temporal lobes in the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a positive titer of anti-LGI 1 antibodies (Abs) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to a diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE. The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) steroids and immunoglobulin and later with IV rituximab. In patients that predominantly present with psychotic and cognitive disorders the diagnosis of anti-LGI 1 LE can be delayed predisposing them to a poorer prognosis (permanent cognitive impairment - especially short-term memory loss - and persistent seizures). It is necessary to be aware of this diagnosis when evaluating acute to sub-acute psychiatric illness developing with cognitive impairment (specially with memory loss) to avoid diagnosis delays and long-term sequelae.",37069884
Anti-metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 encephalitis: Five case reports and literature review.,"To describe the clinical and radiological characteristics of anti-metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) encephalitis. We reviewed the clinical data of five patients with anti-mGluR5 encephalitis, and performed a literature review. The five cases included a 52-year-old man who developed a biphasic course of anti-mGluR5 encephalitis after herpes simplex encephalitis, a 22-year-old woman who showed bilateral basal ganglia lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a 36-year-old man with mixed aphasia and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a 51-year-old man presented with personality changes, hallucinations, delusions, sleeping disorders and a 58-year-old man with short-term memory deficits and absence seizures.. There are 16 reported cases of anti-mGluR5 encephalitis worldwide. Of all 21 patients, with a median onset age of 35 years old, the main neurological symptoms were cognitive impairment (85.7%, 18/21), psychiatric or behavior problems (76.2%, 16/21), seizures (57.1%, 12/21), sleeping disorders (52.4%, 11/21), different degrees of decreased consciousness (42.9%, 9/21), and movement disorders (23.8%, 5/21). Brain MRI was normal in 11 of 21 patients. Lesions of the limbic lobes were presented in 5 patients, while involvement of other extralimbic regions was also reported. Seven of 21 (33.3%) cases were combined with tumors. Elevated white blood cell counts or specific oligoclonal IgG bands in the cerebrospinal fluid were found in 18 of 21 patients, with marked improvements observed after immunotherapy. Patients with anti-mGluR5 encephalitis typically present with diffuse, rather than purely limbic, encephalitis. Anti-mGluR5 encephalitis can be triggered by herpes simplex encephalitis. The risk of a combined tumor may be reduced in anti-mGluR5 encephalitis patients.",37060179
Wernicke's encephalopathy in adolescents with anorexia nervosa.,"Anorexia Nervosa (AN) has always been prevalent in adolescents. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the eating disorder community across the world has noted a sharp increase in adolescent patients with AN and the severity of medical compromise. Rarely seen sequelae have become increasingly more common. This case report describes two previously healthy female adolescents with severe malnutrition due to AN admitted for nutritional stabilization who exhibited paranoid delusions responsive to thiamine and olanzapine. Though neither exhibit the full triad or all the Caine criteria for Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE), the triad will not present completely in most patients with WE, especially in the pediatric population. Having one symptom of the triad is indicative of WE. Due to the decreased number of clinical criteria for Wernicke's encephalopathy coupled with the lack of typical brain MRI findings found in these patients, we recommend a high index of suspicion for WE and investigation with thiamine. Thiamine supplementation should be standard care in AN with oral supplementation in stable conditions. In the case of refeeding syndromes, preventative parenteral thiamine 100 mg IV qd, and in the case of thiamine deficiency, thiamine 500 mg IV TID.",36567898
Case report: Treatment of psychiatric symptoms for an acromegalic patient with pituitary adenoma.,"Acromegalic patients always demonstrate a wide range of clinic manifestations, including typical physical changes such as acral and facial features, as well as untypical neuropsychiatric and psychological disturbances. However, there is still a lack of clinical guidance on the treatment for acromegalic patients with psychiatric comorbidities. We therefore share this case to provide a reference for clinicians to manage the acromegalic patients with psychiatric symptoms. This case report describes a 41-year-old male with an 8-year history of acromegaly due to growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, the maximum cross-sectional area of which was 42 mm × 37 mm demonstrated by pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient received conservative medicine treatment by regularly injecting with Sandostatin LAR 10 mg per month. Two days before admission, he suddenly presented with an acute psychotic episode. In addition to the typical acromegaly-associated changes, his main clinical presentations were olfactory/auditory hallucinations, reference/persecutory delusions, instable emotion and impulsive behavior. Considering the schizophrenic-like psychoses and course features, he was diagnosed with Brief Psychotic Disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) after a multidisciplinary consultation and evaluation. He was prescribed Aripiprazole, which had less extrapyramidal symptoms and minimal influence on prolactin elevation, with the dose of 5 mg per day to control the psychiatric symptoms and he responded quite well. At the time of discharge and the follow-up 2 month later, the patient was stable without recurrence of any psychotic symptoms. The levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) 1 week after discharge were 2.22 ng/mL [normal range (0-2.47 ng/mL)] and 381 μg/L [normal range (94-284 μg/L)], respectively, which were similar to those before the psychotic episode. Results from this report further supported that small dose of Aripiprazole had little influence on hormonal levels and the development of pituitary macroadenoma. This particular case emphasizes the importance for the clinician to master and carefully identify the possible symptoms of mental disorders associated with acromegaly, and also highlights the need for further investigation in more efficient treatment strategies for acromegalic cases with psychiatric comorbidities.",36532182
Musical Ear Syndrome in a Patient with Unilateral Hearing Loss: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Hearing music that has no source is known as musical ear syndrome, also known as musical hallucinations (MH), and is often associated with hearing impairment. This report is of a 62-year-old man with a 20-year history of unilateral hearing loss and continuous MH. We investigated the neural basis of MH in a subject without any known neurological or psychiatric disorders. CASE REPORT A 62-year-old man had a history of 20 years of symptomatic mild hearing loss accompanied with continuous MH in the form of multiple tones. The MH were unilateral in the left side and much more likely to be experienced as externally located and uncontrollable. He underwent structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results indicated increased activity and reduced cortical thickness in multiple cortical areas, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporal and limbic regions, indicating complex processing and involvement. CONCLUSIONS The neurological findings indicate differentiated or multiple-area involvement in MH. These morpho-functional changes may represent a neural reorganization causing MH to arise. The altered or activated regions are all related to the processing of emotions and the processing of episodic memory, which has been seen in the MH of schizophrenic patients. This report also highlights that patients with hearing loss may present with continuous MH, and that these patients should not be assumed to have delusions or psychosis, but should be investigated for underlying auditory abnormalities and treated appropriately.",36123807
Woodhouse-Sakati Syndrome Presenting With Psychotic Features After Starting Trihexyphenidyl: A Case Report.,"Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive, multisystemic disorder first identified as a constellation of hypogonadism, mental retardation, diabetes, alopecia, deafness, and electrocardiogram abnormalities.  We report a case of a 33-year-old woman who was born to consanguineous parents. She is suffering from hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, extrapyramidal symptoms, hypothyroidism, alopecia, and sensorineural hearing loss. Her MRI showed iron depositions in globus pallidus bilaterally. She underwent genetic testing and was diagnosed with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome. She was started on trihexyphenidyl to treat her extrapyramidal symptoms. A few months later, she started to have psychotic symptoms in the form of auditory hallucinations and delusions of persecution.  Although she exhibited psychotic symptoms after starting trihexyphenidyl, it is less likely to be causing her symptoms since the symptoms started a few months after taking the medication and she was not on high doses. Thus, it is more likely to be a part of Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome.",36059322
Psychosis during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review of case reports and case series.,"Preliminary data suggest that patients with COVID-19 may experience psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the concurrence of new-onset psychosis or exacerbation of clinically stable psychosis through case reports and case series. Six databases were searched, followed by an electronic and manual search of the relevant articles. Studies were identified using predetermined eligibility criteria. We evaluated the demographic characteristics, clinical history, course of illness, management, and prognosis of the patients in these studies. Case reports and case series, altogether consisting of 57 unique cases were included. The mean patient age for onset of psychotic symptoms was 43.4 years for men and 40.3 years for women. About 69% of patients had no prior history of psychiatric disorders. Most patients had mild COVID-19-related symptoms, with only 15 (26.3%) presenting with moderate to severe COVID-19-related disease and complications. The most commonly reported psychotic symptoms were delusions and hallucinations. Patients with psychotic symptoms were treated with antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, valproic acid, and electroconvulsive treatment. In 36 cases, psychotic symptoms resolved completely or improved significantly. Ten cases had partial improvement with residual psychotic symptoms, and one patient died due to cardiac arrest. Most patients responded to a low-to-moderate dose of antipsychotics with a quick recovery. However, the residual psychiatric symptoms highlight the need for careful monitoring and longer follow-up. Clinicians should be mindful of the occurrence of psychosis due to COVID-19 infection in a subset of COVID-19 patients that can be misdiagnosed as a psychotic disorder alone.",35797814
Probable progressive supranuclear palsy in a patient with chronic schizophrenia: A case report.,"Rare neurodegenerative disorders may be considered in the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonism in patients with schizophrenia who show worsening signs of Parkinsonism under treatment with antipsychotics. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report describing probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in a patient with chronic schizophrenia. A 64-year-old man presented with hallucinations, delusions and asociality. He had received treatment with both typical and atypical antipsychotics for ~13 years. He began experiencing short-term memory impairment and bradykinesia two years before presentation, and then showed increased dysphagia, upper-limb muscle rigidity, extrapyramidal symptoms, vision loss and photophobia. Psychological manifestations included chronic depression, irritability and, occasionally, euphoria. His gait worsened, leading to repeated falls. Antipsychotics were discontinued, and the patient was almost completely dependent on a wheelchair in daily life. In a neurology consultation, he was diagnosed with probable progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome presenting as vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and prominent postural instability with falls. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed atrophy of the mesencephalic tegmentum, and <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed reduced bilateral striatal reuptake. Overall, PSP should be considered in patients with schizophrenia with worsening Parkinsonism, especially when it is accompanied by supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, pseudobulbar palsy, dysarthria and dystonic stiffness of the neck and upper body. In the present case, the combination of brain MRI and <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane SPECT helped to discriminate PSP from other Parkinsonian syndromes, including drug-induced Parkinsonism, in the differential diagnosis.",35761809
A novel compound heterozygous SPG7 variant is associated with progressive spastic ataxia and persecutory delusions found in Chinese patients: two case reports.,"Hereditary spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7) is one of the subtypes of autosomal-recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia, which is a clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. SPG7 often displays a complicated phenotype, including optic atrophy, ophthalmoparesis, and impaired emotional communication. In the Chinese population, sporadic cases of SPG7 variant-associated spastic ataxia are rarely reported. We carefully analysed the clinical features, imaging and genetic tests of two sporadic patients with SPG7, both from the Hebei region of China. One patient presented with progressive bilateral lower limb weakness, spastic-ataxia and no cognitive impairment. Brain MRI revealed mild cerebellar atrophy. Genetic analysis revealed c.1150_1151insCTAC (p.G384Afs*13) frameshift variant and exon1-3 heterozygous deletion. The other patient presented with progressive bilateral lower limb weakness, ataxia, dysarthria and a mild psychosis associated with persecutory delusions, which drew almost no attention, in addition to mild cognitive impairments characterized by a decrease in verbal memory and executive function. Genetic analysis identified two heterozygous variants in the SPG7 gene: c.1150_1151insCTAC (p.G384Afs*13) and c.1496delC (p.Q500Sfs*13). The c.1496delC (p.Q500Sfs*13) variant in exon 11 has not been reported before. The c.1150_1151insCTAC variant is speculated to be a hotspot variant in the Chinese population. Patients with SPG7 may have cognitive impairments and psychosis, displaying specific characteristics, which should be of concern.",35637455
Psychosis Associated with Acquired Porencephaly-Cause or Incidental Finding? Case Report and Review of Literature.,"Porencephaly, a rare disease affecting the central nervous system, is represented by a cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavity in the brain. There are two types of porencephalic cavities: congenital and acquired. Porencephaly is mainly associated with neurological and developmental consequences. Associated psychotic symptoms were reported in a few cases, and due to this fact, there is a knowledge gap regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to such cases. We present the case of a 32-year-old male diagnosed with a psychotic disorder associated with acquired porencephaly. The porencephalic cystic lesions were most probably due to a traumatic brain injury at the age of 6 years old. The psychotic symptomatology consisted of interoceptive/visceral hallucinations, delusions with persecutory and religious/magic content and disorganised behaviour. The porencephalic cavity was confirmed by a computed tomography scan. The patient was treated over the course of time with risperidone, olanzapine and zuclopenthixol. The existing literature regarding other cases of psychosis associated with porencephaly is discussed. In conclusion, even though porencephaly was asymptomatic for a long period of time, we argue that there is a causal relationship between the chronic psychotic symptoms and the porencephalic cyst in our case.",35630003
Ectopic adrenocorticotrophic hormone syndrome initially presenting as abnormal mental behavior caused by thymic carcinoid: a case report.,"Thymic carcinoid is a rare highly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm, which can manifest as endocrine disorders caused by ectopic adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) syndrome. Although clinical manifestations such as hypertension and hypokalemia are common manifestations in patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome, clinicians should also be aware of the mental and behavioral abnormalities that may initially appear in patients. It is extremely rare for patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome caused by thymic carcinoid to concurrently exhibit abnormal mental behavior, especially as the initial clinical manifestation of the tumor. Studies have suggested that abnormal mental behavior may be related to elevated blood cortisol levels. A patient was admitted to hospital due to abnormal mental behavior, manifesting as hyperphasia involving gibberish and illogical language, trance, and a state of suspicion. The patient had experienced persecutory delusion. Auxiliary examination revealed elevated cortisol and ACTH. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed right anterior mediastinal tumor. After discussion, the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) concluded that ectopic ACTH syndrome derived from the thymus should be considered. After excluding surgical contraindications, a thymic tumor was resected, and the postoperative pathology confirmed that it was thymic carcinoid. At 6 postoperative months, the results were as follows: cortisol at 8:00 am 196.50 nmol/L; and ACTH at 8:00 am 28.63 pg/mL. The patient's mental behavior had returned to normal, and normal communication was possible. The postoperative symptoms and signs of the patient were improved, which reiterated the presence ectopic ACTH syndrome caused by thymic carcinoid. Thymic carcinoid with ectopic ACTH syndrome is very rare in clinical practice, and it is easily missed and misdiagnosed. Although clinical manifestations such as hypertension and hypokalemia are common manifestations in patients with Cushing's syndrome, clinicians should be aware that patients with Cushing's syndrome may initially exhibit abnormal mental behavior. Clinically, if the patient exhibits abnormal mental behavior accompanied by symptoms such as hypokalemia, hypertension, and diabetes, blood cortisol and ACTH hormone levels should be screened without delay. If the levels are found to be significantly increased, ACTH syndrome should be highly suspected.",35531113
First Episode Psychosis and Pituitary Hyperplasia in a Patient With Untreated Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: A Case Report.,"This case report describes a woman with no psychiatric history and previously diagnosed Hashimoto's thyroiditis who presented to the psychiatric emergency department with a first episode of psychosis. The initial workup for organic causes of psychosis revealed an astronomically high thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (> 1,000 μIU/mL) out of proportion to the patient's minimal physical symptoms of hypothyroidism. Additionally the patient's head imaging showed an enlarged pituitary, a rare, but reversible, presentation of chronically untreated primary hypothyroidism. The patient was transferred to a medical unit to receive IV thyroid hormone replacement as well as an adjunctive antipsychotic to assist with remission of her distressing auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions. This case highlights the importance of a thorough medical workup for causes of new onset psychosis and the need for further consensus in the literature regarding choice of antipsychotic and duration of treatment for psychosis secondary to hypothyroidism.",35401262
Mega cisterna magna in bipolar mood disorder: a case report.,"Mega cisterna magna (MCM), one of the members of the Dandy-Walker complex, is a developmental malformation of the posterior fossa that is larger than 10 mm but morphologically does not affect the vermis and cerebellar hemispheres. Reports of psychiatric disorders associated with this anomaly are rare. We present the case of a patient with MCM who presented with a psychotic manic attack and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. A 28-year-old female, single housewife, university graduate, presented with irritability, decreased sleep and appetite, distraction, and agitation. The patient also had a delusion of reference. In the clinical follow-up, an increase in energy and an increase in the amount of speech were observed. Her neurological examination was normal, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed an MCM. The relationship and clinical significance of MCM with psychosis and mood disorders have not yet been fully elucidated. It is not known whether this association is accidental or based on etiological commonality. The purpose of this case report is to review the relationship between the cerebellum and psychiatric symptoms and to contribute to the literature.",35067008
A presumptive association between obsessive compulsions and asymmetric temporal lobe atrophy: a case report.,"The relatively isolated atrophy of the temporal lobes leads to a clinical radiological pattern, referred to as the temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia. While semantic dementia and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia are classically related to this syndrome, the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia has been less commonly reported. This case report aims to give a pictorial description of a case in which a patient with asymmetric temporal lobe atrophy presented with the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia and complex rituals of cleanliness. We report on the case of a 68-year-old, right-handed White woman with complex rituals and progressive speech impairment. The obsessive-compulsive rituals represented an exacerbation of lifelong preoccupations with cleanliness and orderliness that were praised by her relatives. Neuropsychological assessment revealed a striking impairment of language and memory, with relative sparing of tool-use praxis and visuospatial skills. Magnetic resonance imaging and <sup>18</sup>fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans showed bilateral asymmetrical temporal lobe atrophy and hypometabolism. A year later, she was still able to entertain conversation for a short while, but her vocabulary and fluency had further declined. Praxis and visuospatial skills remained intact. She did not experience pathological elation, delusions, or hallucinations. The disease followed a relentless progression into a partial Klüver-Bucy syndrome, abulia, and terminal dementia. She died from acute myocardial infarction 8 years after the onset of aphasia. The symptoms and their temporal course supported a diagnosis of logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia due to asymmetric temporal variant frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This report gives a pictorial description of a temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia in a patient who presented with worsening of a lifelong obsessive-compulsive disorder and logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia.",35045865
Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis in older adults: A systematic review of case reports.,"To ascertain the clinical characteristics of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) in older patients. A systematic literature review using PubMed and Scopus of all published case reports of NMDARE was undertaken, from database inception to June 2020. From this, cases reporting on patients older than 65 years of age and whose diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies in CSF were selected. 23 case reports fulfilling the study's criteria were found. Median age was 70.1 years (range 65-84), fourteen were female (60.9%), and mostly presented with acute behavioral and cognitive changes (95.7%). Atypical psychosis occurred in eleven patients (47.8%) with a sudden onset and fluctuating clinical pattern of delusions (39.1%), hallucinations (30.4%), and motility disturbances (34.8%) including catatonia (17.4%). Nine patients presented with seizures (39.1%). Pleocytosis in CSF (>5 WBC) was described in twelve cases (52.2%). Eleven cases (47.8%) had abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with limbic inflammatory lesions. Thirteen patients had an abnormal EEG (56.5%). NMDARE should be included in the differential diagnosis of older patients who present with new psychiatric episodes, especially when characterized by sudden onset psychotic polymorphic symptomatology, fluctuating course with marked cognitive decline, and with catatonic features.",34929551
Relapse of Psychosis Status Post Meningioma Resection.,"A 53-year-old Caucasian female with a previous psychiatric history of bipolar I disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder presented to the emergency department after endorsing 10-11 months of auditory and visual hallucinations, persecutory delusions, depression, anosmia, weakness of lower extremities, and headache. The patient described her auditory hallucinations as non-commanding voices talking to her about her family, her visual hallucinations as seeing ""shadows and shapes,"" and her paranoid delusions as people coming after her. The patient had sustained a fall a week and a half earlier, requiring eight sutures to her posterior scalp. Her MRI of the brain showed a well-circumscribed 3.5 x 4.7 x 3.2 cm mass in the floor of the anterior cranial fossa. Computer tomography of the brain showed a 4.5 cm mass near the anterior interhemispheric fissure and edema in the right frontal cortex. Meningioma resection resulted in the cessation of hallucinations and delusions for one week. However, the patient was brought back to the emergency department because her auditory hallucinations and delusions returned. This case report demonstrates residual psychosis, even after frontal meningioma resection.",34746494
Suicide attempt induced by drug-induced leukoencephalopathy: A case report.,"Leukoencephalopathy is identified during the administration of anticancer drugs. Symptoms vary from neurological symptoms to psychiatric symptoms depending on the site of damage. There have been no previous reports of suicide attempts due to drug-induced leukoencephalopathy. The patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) infiltrating the pharyngeal lesion. Rituximab + methotrexate + oncovin + procarbazine (R-MPV) therapy, a methotrexate-containing chemotherapy, was initiated. At the end of the fifth course, the patient attempted suicide by hanging with an appliance cord, which was associated with delusion. A head MRI scan showed no evidence of lymphoma recurrence, but white matter lesions around the ventricles showed progression. We report the case of a patient in whom drug-induced leukoencephalopathy related to methotrexate led to a suicide attempt. In addition to monitoring brain tumors, daily monitoring of psychiatric and neurological symptoms is important for patients with methotrexate-induced encephalopathy.",34652886
Case Report: Usefulness of Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease in Two Cases With Very-Late-Onset Schizophrenia-Like Psychosis.,"The association between primary psychotic disorders emerging in later life and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), is controversial. We present two female non-demented cases of psychosis with onset above the age of 60 years. Cases 1 and 2 were aged was 68 and 81 years, respectively. They suffered from persecutory delusions and scored 28 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at the first examination. Although detailed neuropsychological tests detected amnesia, they had preserved daily life function. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, N-isopropyl-p-[123I] iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) single-photon emission computed tomography, and cardiac [123I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy showed no specific abnormalities in either case. We diagnosed them with very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP) because there was no evidence that their psychoses were derived from organic diseases or affective disorders. Upon close inspection, the AD biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing and Florbetapir F 18 positron emission tomography (PET), were positive in Case 1 and negative in Case 2. Case 1 scored 25 1 year later and 23 2 years later on the MMSE and was finally diagnosed as AD dementia. These two cases suggest that some clinically diagnosed VLOSLPs may be a prodromal AD. Although VLOSLP is a disease entity supposed to be a primary psychotic disorder, some are probably secondary psychosis with insidious neurodegeneration. Advanced biomarkers such as amyloid PET and CSF may contribute to the detection of secondary psychosis from clinically diagnosed VLOSLP.",34594255
Atypical Charles Bonnet syndrome secondary to frontal meningioma: a case report.,"Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) is a rare clinical entity that is classically composed of visual hallucinations in the context of an altered optic pathway with preservation of reality judgment. This case aims to present the association of visual hallucinations with complex alterations of the nervous structures adjacent to the visual pathway and an atypical clinical presentation, thus explaining the possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these symptoms. A 43-year-old man presents seeking care due to visual hallucinations with partial preservation of reality judgment and symptoms compatible with a major depressive disorder, including irritability and diminished hygiene habits. He has a history of complete gradual loss of vision and hyposmia. Due to poor treatment response during hospitalization, an MRI was obtained, which showed a frontal tumor lesion with meningioma characteristics adjacent to the olfactory groove and compression of the optic chiasm. He underwent surgical resection of the lesion, which remitted the psychotic symptoms, but preserving the visual limitation and depressive symptoms. The presence of visual hallucinations, without other psychotic features as delusions, is a focus of attention for basic structural pathologies in the central nervous system. Affection at any level of the visual pathway can cause CBS. When finding atypical symptoms, a more in-depth evaluation should be made to allow optimization of the diagnosis and treatment.",34294066
Psychosis and Dandy-Walker syndrome: a case report and review of the literature.,"Dandy-Walker syndrome (DWS) is a group of brain malformations which sometimes present with psychotic symptoms. We present the case of a patient diagnosed with Dandy-Walker variant who presented with schizophrenia-like psychosis. A man in his 30s was admitted to an acute psychiatric unit presenting with persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and violent behaviour. The MRI performed showed the typical alterations of Dandy-Walker variant: vermian hypoplasia and cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle. He also suffered from mild intellectual disability. After being treated with olanzapine 10 mg/d for a month, his psychotic symptoms greatly improved and he was discharged. In conclusion, DWS may cause psychosis through a dysfunction in the circuit connecting prefrontal, thalamic and cerebellar areas. The association between these two conditions may contribute to the understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.",33937630
Tuberous sclerosis complex-associated neuropsychiatric disorder (TAND) in a low-resource setting - From seizure to psychosis: A case report.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients commonly present with neuropsychiatric symptoms - grouped as TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorder (TAND) - incorporating Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms, intellectual and learning disabilities, psychiatric and behavioral problems. A structured symptomatic assessment known as the TAND-checklist can be useful in reviewing these symptoms systematically and comprehensively. A 21-year-old woman presented with delusions of reference, auditory hallucinations, irritability, restlessness, aggressive behavior, new-onset tremors and rigidity in both upper limbs, and refusal of food and medication intake for 1 week. She has a history of several seizure episodes since 3 years of age which was controlled on oral sodium valproate, carbamazepine, and clobazam. MRI revealed tubers in frontal and insular cortex.Ultrasound of the abdomen showed bilateral renal angiomyolipomas. She was diagnosed with TSC with psychotic symptoms. TSC2 mutations usually present early with epileptic spasms (ES), complex epilepsies, intellectual and cognitive deficits, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and sub-ependymal giant-cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) with high tuber-to-brain proportions (TBP). There is also a remarkable symptom overlap between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and TSC with behavioral/psychiatric disorders. Social and behavioral problems seen in our patient may be a manifestation of either TSC, ASD, or both. Cost-effectiveness and pragmatism must be considered for TAND-patients in low-resource settings. While it may be theoretically valid to seek genetic testing, TBP-measurement, and mTOR-inhibitor therapy to address TAND-symptoms, they are impractical when compared to TAND-checklist during follow-up.",33425343
Sheehan Syndrome Presenting with Psychotic Manifestations Mimicking Schizophrenia in a Young Female: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,"Sheehan syndrome presents with features of multiple hormone deficiencies including lactation failure and amenorrhoea as well as with features of central hypothyroidism and adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency. Psychiatric manifestations are mostly limited to cognitive impairment. Psychotic presentations are rare and limited to case reports. <i>Case Presentation</i>. A 32-year-old female was evaluated for fearfulness and delusions for one year. She had persecutory and bizarre delusions, delusion of thought possession, and elementary auditory hallucinations. These began four months after the birth of her third child. The delivery had been complicated with postpartum haemorrhage. Her symptoms caused the functional decline and progressively worsened, resulting in suicidal ideation. Cognitive assessment revealed mild impairment in attention. Further inquiry revealed lethargy, constipation, cold intolerance, and lactation failure. She was slow, having dry skin, puffy face, and bradycardia with a blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg (supine) and 70/50 mmHg (standing). She had hyponatraemia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, low thyroxine, prolactin, FSH, LH, and IGF-1. She had poor cortisol and growth hormone response to the insulin tolerance test. MRI-pituitary showed empty sella. A diagnosis of Sheehan syndrome was made. Her symptoms improved completely after the initiation of levothyroxine and hydrocortisone. Sheehan syndrome can present with psychotic symptoms mimicking schizophrenia with variable involvement of cognition. Detailed reporting of these patients would enhance better characterization of the clinical presentation and risk profile of these patients.",33343948
Manic episode in patient with bipolar disorder and recent multiple sclerosis diagnosis: A case report.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with a higher prevalence of mood and psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder (BD). While mania is most often associated with BD, MS can also induce manic symptoms. However, it is crucial to distinguish which condition is causing mania since medical management is different based on its etiology. Herein, we report a case of a manic episode in a middle-aged female with a prolonged history of BD who received a recent diagnosis of MS 1 year ago. A 56-year-old female presented with an episode of mania and psychosis while receiving a phenobarbital taper for chronic lorazepam use. She had a prolonged history of bipolar type 1 disorder and depression. She showed optic neuritis and was diagnosed with MS a year prior. The patient was diagnosed with BD-induced mania based on the absence of increased demyelination compared to previous MRI and lack of new focal or lateralizing neurologic findings of MS. Lithium was given for mood stabilization and decreased dosage of prior antidepressant medication. Risperidone was given for ongoing delusions. After 8 days of hospitalization, patient's mania improved but demonstrated atypical features and ongoing delusions. She was discharged at her request to continue treatment in an outpatient setting. In BD patients with an episode of mania, MS should be included in the differential, since both conditions can cause manic symptoms. The origin of mania should be delineated through a detailed neurological exam, neuroimaging, and thorough patient-family psychiatric history for appropriate clinical treatment.",33080761
Hashimoto's Encephalopathy Revealed by Hypochondriacal Delusion: A Case Report Involving a Male Patient.,"Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE) is a rare autoimmune disorder. It associates encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis, presenting abnormal elevations of thyroid antibodies. It is more common in females. It can present with various symptoms, including seizures, myoclonus, psychosis, hallucinations, and mood disturbances. Hypochondriacal delusion is an unusual clinical presentation of this disorder. The authors report a case of HE in a male patient whose clinical presentation was dominated by hypochondriacal delusion. The absence of response to antipsychotics, high serum antithyroid peroxidase antibodiesof about 199 UI/ml, the normality of magnetic resonance imaging, and improvement with corticosteroids confirmed the diagnosis. This neuroendocrine disorder is often misdiagnosed and it represents a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. It should be considered in patients presenting a refractory or an atypical neuropsychiatric disorder and having a family history of autoimmune disease.",32938289
Neuropsychiatric symptoms as the only acute manifestation of a stroke in the left hemisphere. Case report.,"We report the case of a 60-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, who suddenly presented with a clinical picture of emotional lability, disorientation, complex visual hallucinations and persecutory delusions. There were no associated neurological findings in her initial physical examination. At a local hospital she was initially diagnosed with late-onset bipolar disorder and a manic episode with psychotic features, then referred to the mental health unit, where nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging of the brain revealed an acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) with haemorrhagic reperfusion to the occipital cortex. Complete and spontaneous resolution of her clinical condition was achieved after approximately 15 days.",32888663
Re-emerging Neurosyphilis in Korea as a Possible Etiology of Psychotic Disorders with Pleomorphic Symptoms and Cognitive Dysfunction: a Case Report and Literature Review.,"Infectious diseases of immigrant populations have recently become important issues for the health of both Korean nationals and foreigners living in Korea. This case report of general paresis is intended to raise awareness about re-emerging neurosyphilis in Korea as a possible etiology of psychotic disorders. A 68-year-old male Chinese resident came to Korea in 2019 with disorientation, auditory hallucination, persecutory delusion, and aggressive behavior, and was admitted to a psychiatric ward for further evaluation and treatment via the emergency department. He was confirmed to have neurosyphilis by serum test, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. After treatment with antibiotics, including intravenous penicillin, in combination with atypical antipsychotics for 6 weeks, his disorientation, auditory hallucination, delusion, and aggressive behavior had attenuated. Neurosyphilis should still be included as a possible etiology of psychotic disorders in Korea. At the initial evaluation, syphilis screening serum tests are recommended for psychotic patients, especially those with pleomorphic symptoms and cognitive dysfunction.",32830465
Capgras Syndrome in the Young: Schizophrenia or Alzheimer Disease?,"This is a case report of an atypical presentation of early onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) in a young patient with Capgras syndrome and cognitive impairment. The concurrent onset of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms prompted a detailed evaluation for a neurodegenerative disease. A 50-year-old male lawyer presented with low mood, apathy, delusions, and auditory hallucinations over 18 months. He considered his wife as an imposter and would require her text message to confirm her identity. He became more forgetful and had to give up his law practice. His neuropsychological assessment was impaired in all domains. Genetic testing revealed homozygosity for APOEe4 alleles. His magnetic resonance imaging showed predominant parietal and medial temporal atrophy, [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed frontal, parietal and posterior temporal hypometabolism and [18F]Flutemetamol positron emission tomography was positive for amyloid deposition, leading to the diagnosis of EOAD. This case highlights EOAD as a differential diagnosis in young patients who present with Capgras syndrome.",31913960
Iatrogenic cerebral abscess leading to resolution of severe delusional disorder.,"A cerebral abscess (focal infection of brain parenchyma) carries a high mortality and morbidity. Iatrogenic cerebral abscesses are less common and make up 10% of all cases. The presence of a cerebral abscess can rarely improve a patient's prognosis and quality of life, however this case illustrates an abscess and its treatment following a prolonged course of antibiotics leading to resolution of a severe psychotic disorder. This is a case report of a 32-year-old female inpatient at a psychiatric hospital with a long-standing history of congenital hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy and organic delusional disorder who developed an iatrogenic cerebral abscess after insertion of an implantable intracranial pressure monitoring device. After receiving treatment of 6 weeks of intravenous meropenem the patient's mental condition rapidly improved, she became stable and euthymic and was discharged home. The patient has since had no delusions or hallucinations and is living independently at home.",31796437
Schizoaffective disorder comorbid with type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by frontotemporal atrophy and impaired cognition: A CARE compliant case report.,"Brain atrophy coupled with impaired cognition may be a sign of dementia. However, growing evidence indicates that schizoaffective disorder (SAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) play roles in the processes of frontotemporal atrophy and cognitive decline. Few cases of frontotemporal atrophy and impaired cognition have been reported in young adult patients with SAD and T2DM. A 34-year-old man was admitted for his 19th rehospitalization due to auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs), delusions of persecution, mania, and fluctuating blood sugar levels. After admission, a brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the patient's frontotemporal atrophy, which was first found in 2014, had gradually degenerated over time. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) revealed cognitive impairments. Based on the clinical assessment, his cognition and social function impairments were determined to mainly result from SAD and T2DM because the clinical characteristics and course of the disease did not coincide with the features of progressive aggravation of dementia. Diagnoses include the following: SAD-mania and T2DM. Paliperidone and sodium valproate coupled with quetiapine add-on treatment were prescribed for the patient. The therapeutic strategy had a limited effect on the patient. Early onset of SAD and T2DM, as well as irregular treatment, resulting in brain atrophy coupled with cognitive impairments, may be the main causes of the patient's treatment resistance and poor outcome. The risks and benefits of treatment strategies should be individually assessed. Further neuroimaging, pertinent biomarkers, and genetic tests along with long-term follow-up are needed for precise evaluation of the patient's condition.",31008977
Successful treatment of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with early teratoma removal and plasmapheresis: A case report.,"This report describes a Successful treatment of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with early teratoma removal and plasmapheresis. We present a 31-year-old Caucasian nulliparous patient who was admitted as an emergency with general illness status accompanied by holocranial cephalalgia and fever. The previous symptoms were followed by disorientation, persecutory delusion, incoherent language, and tonic-clonic seizure. The patient was admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) with Glasgow score 7. Most of complementary exams (brain CT, brain MRI, blood analysis, PCR for virus on CSF) were normal except CSF leucocytosis and hyperproteinorrhachia. An abdominopelvic ultrasound revealed a 5-cm solid-cystic tumor in the left adnexal region, suggestive of teratoma. At that stage, the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis was considered, and confirmed later. This disease can only be successfully treated with fast surgical intervention and an early implementation of immunosuppressive therapies. The optimal timing of initiation and duration of therapeutic plasma exchange necessary to achieve good outcomes in patients with NMDAR remains unknown. This case report intends to increase awareness about the importance of early surgical treatment and early implementation of this potentially life-saving therapy and of continuing the treatment until complete remission of symptoms.",30075499
Neurological disorders caused by two cerebral alveolar hydatid cysts in an old woman: a rare case report.,"Alveolar hydatid disease, caused by <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i>, is a life-threatening infectious disease which primarily occurs in the liver. Intracranial hydatid disease is a rare presentation with reported incidence of ~1% of all cases. Here we reported a 60-year-old woman, with the past history of hydatid cysts in her liver, who was presented to us with progressive symptoms consist of headaches, diminished vision, cognitive disorders and delusion. She was disoriented in time, space and person. Bilateral mild papilledema and exaggerated reflexes were observed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed two intra-axial multilucular cystic masses in the fronto-pareital and parieto-occipital regions. The patient underwent two operations and the lesions were removed without any rupture. Medical therapy with Albendazole was started. Neurological symptoms disappeared a few weeks after the surgeries. Although multiple alveolar hydatid cysts are extremely rare, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intracranial cystic lesions.",29744124
Case Report of Cushing's Syndrome with an Acute Psychotic Presentation.,"A 36-year-old Chinese woman was brought to the emergency department of a general hospital with a 3-day history of mania, persecutory delusions, and suicidal ideation; she also had a 6-month history of disrupted sleep, hypervigilance, and somatic symptoms. Her physical exam on admission to the psychosomatic ward identified a moon-shaped face, exophthalmos, and purple striae on her legs, so acute psychiatric symptoms secondary to Cushing's syndrome was suspected. Elevated plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and identification of a mass on her left adrenal gland on the computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen confirmed the diagnosis. Low dose quetiapine (75-125 mg/d) and alprazolam (0.4 mg/qn) were prescribed to control the psychotic symptoms and improve her sleep. After surgical removal of a benign ACTH-independent adrenal tumor, her cortisol and ACTH levels returned to normal and her psychiatric symptoms gradually diminished over a one-month period, at which point she was discharged. Low-dose quetiapine was continued for 2 months after discharge and then discontinued; by this time her psychiatric symptoms had completely disappeared. In this case the patient had pathognomonic symptoms of CS, so it was relatively easy to make the diagnosis; but acute psychotic symptoms in CS can be life-threatening and may not be associated with the typical physical symptoms of CS (if there is only modest hypercortisolemia), so psychiatric clinicians should always consider CS among the possible differential diagnoses for unexplained acute psychosis.",28638188
Two Cases of Oral Somatic Delusions Ameliorated With Brain Perfusion Asymmetry: A Case Report.,"Oral cenesthopathy is the complaint of abnormal oral sensation where no underlying organic cause can be identified. It is also called oral dysesthesia or oral somatic delusion and classified as delusional disorder, somatic type. The patients with oral cenesthopathy show right > left asymmetric regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the broad brain region. However, the studies scrutinizing the rCBF change before and after the successful treatment are still a few so far. We present 2 cases of oral cenesthopathy, who responded well to aripiprazole. The asymmetric rCBF patterns were attenuated after successful treatment in both cases. We found a marked improvement of oral cenesthopathy with aripiprazole. It is suggested that right > left rCBF asymmetry in the frontal and temporal lobes and thalamus, and the dopaminergic and serotonergic dysfunctions are involved in the pathology of oral cenesthopathy.",28225385
Case report of Lewy body disease mimicking Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a 44-year-old man.,"Few patients are reported with dementia with Lewy bodies before fifty years-old, which may partly reflect the difficulty of accurate diagnosis in young population. We report the case of a 44-year-old male with pathologically confirmed sporadic dementia with Lewy bodies, who did not fulfil the revised clinical criteria for this disease. We document this atypical case with clinical and cognitive evaluation, imaging, biochemistry, genetics and pathology investigations. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was first suspected in this patient with no previous medical history, who developed acute and rapid cognitive impairment, L-dopa-non-responsive parkinsonism, and delusion. Positive 14-3-3 protein was initially detected in cerebrospinal fluid and until the late stages of the disease. Severe atrophy with no diffusion hypersignal was found on structural MRI as well as an extensive hypometabolism on (18)F-FDG-PET, in comparison to age-matched healthy volunteers. Genetic investigation found no alpha-synuclein gene mutation. The patient died within 5 years, and post-mortem examination found numerous Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites consistent with pure Lewy body disease. This comprehensively described case illustrates that dementia with Lewy bodies can occur in young patients with atypical clinical presentation. Biochemistry and neuroimaging investigations can sometimes be insufficient to allow accurate diagnostic. More specific markers to support such diagnosis are needed.",27475058
Meningioma and psychiatric symptoms: A case report and brief review.,"Atypical presentation of psychiatric symptoms can lead to a variety of misdiagnoses. Organic causes, including brain tumors, should be considered under these circumstances. We present a case report of an 84-year-old woman with irritable, aggressive, and delusional behavior. Her earlier diagnoses included altered mental status, encephalopathy, dementia, nonspecified psychosis, and delirium with delusions. We suspected that a brain tumor could be causing her psychiatric symptoms. CT of the head revealed 2 calcified meningiomas, which did not require surgery. Neuropsychological testing results were consistent with frontal lesion type of cognitive and psychotic symptoms. Psychiatric symptoms improved with risperidone. A brief review of the literature is included. Brain imaging should be considered in cases of atypical psychiatric presentations. Past medical records and neuropsychological testing could assist in the diagnosis.",25954939
Steroid psychosis caused by perioperative steroid replacement for pituitary adenoma: a case report.,"Steroid psychosis is a frequent complication of steroid treatment. Although perioperative steroid replacement therapy is generally administered in patients undergoing pituitary surgery, there are no previous reports concerning the development of steroid psychosis after perioperative steroid replacement therapy following pituitary surgery. We herein report a case of steroid psychosis induced by perioperative steroid replacement therapy for pituitary surgery. A 35-year-old man presented with a visual disturbance that had persisted for 1 year. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a large pituitary tumor, and a laboratory study revealed slight dysfunction of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. The patient was diagnosed with a non-functioning pituitary tumor and underwent tumor resection via the endoscopic endonasal approach. The initial dose of perioperative steroid replacement therapy was 200 mg of hydrocortisone administered immediately before the operation. The replacement dose was gradually tapered and discontinued over a 7-day period. On postoperative day 4, the patient exhibited an elated mood, grandiose delusions, anxiety, and agitation. We diagnosed these psychiatric symptoms as steroid psychosis induced by steroid replacement and we prescribed risperidone as a treatment. The symptoms gradually improved and did not recur. This case highlights the risk of steroid psychosis following treatment with perioperative steroid replacement therapy for pituitary adenoma and raises questions regarding the appropriateness of perioperative steroid replacement for pituitary adenoma.",25833261
Psychosis in primary angiitis of the central nervous system involving bilateral thalami: a case report.,"To report a case of primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), a rare inflammatory disease restricted to the central nervous system (CNS), with unusual clinical presentation mimicking schizophrenia. Case report. A 45-year-old male presented with alteration of consciousness and confusion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a mass-like enhancing lesion involving bilateral thalami, and biopsy revealed findings compatible with PACNS. The patient was treated with corticosteroids. Psychotic symptoms crystallized over the initial 2 months after the diagnosis and persisted for over a year. Severity of his symptoms improved with gradual normalization of the radiologic findings and antipsychotic medication. Our case highlights the importance of considering PACNS as a differential diagnosis of a tumor-like mass lesion in the CNS and the significance of thalamic involvement in the pathogenesis of psychotic symptoms including delusions and hallucinations.",25818085
Paranoid personality masking an atypical case of frontotemporal dementia.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a debilitating disease that is well described in the ""Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5)"", and typically presents with memory impairment, progressive decline in cortical functioning, and behavioral changes. Age of onset is generally in the late fifties, and usually the first presentation involves a change in behavior and emotional blunting. Treatment of FTD involves management of any neurobehavioral symptoms while trials of atypical antipsychotics are ongoing but suggest some efficacy. We present a case of a patient who first presented with severe paranoid personality traits and frank persecutory delusions. This atypical presentation of our patient first led to her incorrect diagnosis of a psychotic disorder and paranoid personality disorder. As a result of this diagnosis, she was treated unsuccessfully. A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) then showed atrophy of frontal and temporal lobes bilaterally (left more prominent than right) which confirmed the diagnosis of FTD. The importance of this case involves the atypical presentation of paranoia and delusions, and our patient's incorrect diagnosis based on her clinical presentation led to a trial of unsuccessful treatment. Only after performing an MRI, which showed atrophy, was the patient appropriately treated and deemed medically stable. This case report illustrates the importance of considering a rare presentation of frontotemporal lobe dementia with patients who are in the typical age range and present with paranoia and delusions.",25780487
Early onset frontotemporal dementia with psychiatric presentation due to the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion: a case report.,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) may present with psychiatric symptoms, usually together with neurological ones and in cases with a family history of dementia. We describe the case of an FTD behavioural variant with a psychiatric presentation and a normal neurological examination, due to a C9Orf72 gene mutation. The patient was a 57 years-old Caucasian woman with a recent onset of bizarre behaviours and mystic delusions. She had a negative clinical history for previous psychiatric disorders and treatments and this was her first admission to a Psychiatry Ward. A careful assessment was performed including, beyond psychiatric evaluation, the following: blood sampling, neurological examination (including electroencephalogram, electroencephalogram with zygomatic electrodes, Positron Emission Tomography, Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis), carotid artery Doppler ultrasound, brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging - angio Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Blood sampling for the genetic assessment of mutations associated to primary dementias was performed as well: the genes investigated were FUS, C9Orf72, PSEN-1, PSEN-2. Serological tests were negative, neurological examination was normal, instrumental examinations showed theta waves in the posterior temporal areas bilaterally and frontotemporal cortical atrophy bilaterally. The genetic assessment of mutations associated revealed she carried a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (at least 80 repeats) in C9Orf72 intron 1. Patients carrying the C9Orf72 mutation are likely to receive a psychiatric diagnosis (mainly mood disorder or schizophrenia) prior to correct diagnosis; this may be particularly problematic for those patients with no neurological signs to orientate diagnosis. Understanding the manner in which such FTD variant may present as a psychiatric syndrome, with a negative neurological examination, is essential to provide the best treatment for patients, as soon as possible, especially when the behavioural anomalies interfere with their care.",25433797
[Idiopathic bilateral basal ganglia calcification (Fahr's disease) presenting with psychotic depression and criminal violence: a case report with forensic aspect].,"Fahr's disease is a rare neuropsychiatric disease characterized by bilateral intracranial calcification, primarily in the basal ganglia. The more general term, Fahr's syndrome, is used for primary and secondary basal ganglia calcification, regardless of the etiology, but the term Fahr's disease is used to describe primary, idiopathic cases. Fahr's disease may present with neurological symptoms, such as parkinsonism and extrapyramidal symptoms, dysarthria, paresis, convulsion, and syncope. Psychiatric disorders, including behavioral disorders, psychosis, and mood disorders, as well as cognitive disorders can occur. CT is useful for the diagnosis of Fahr's disease. Herein we present a patient diagnosed as Fahr's disease that presented with symptoms of depression, delusions, and auditory hallucinations. The 47-year-old male patient was hospitalized in a forensic psychiatry inpatient clinic due to aggressive behavior and was subsequently diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic features. While hospitalized he was treated with antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs, as well as electroconvulsive therapy, resulting in significant improvement in his symptoms. As bilateral basal ganglia calcification was observed via CT, the patient was diagnosed as Fahr's disease. This case report emphasizes the importance of cranial imaging and detailed laboratory examination when evaluating patients with psychosis and affective symptoms. Pathologies such as Fahr's disease must be included in the differential diagnosis, especially in cases with neurological symptoms and cranial imaging findings.",24936761
Spontaneous rupture of intracranial dermoid tumor in a patient with vertigo. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings.,"Congenital dermoid cysts are very rare, constituting less than 1% of intracranial tumors. Spontaneous rupture of dermoid tumor is a potentially serious complication that can lead to meningitis, seizures, cerebral ischemia and hydrocephalus. Occasionally, dermoid tumors are incidentally discovered on computed tomography (CT) of the brain or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following unrelated clinical complaints. They are also discovered during radiologic investigations of unexplained headaches, seizures, and rarely olfactory delusions. In this report we describe a patient complaining of vertigo caused by spontaneous rupture of dermoid cyst, preoperatively diagnosed by CT and MRI. Cranial CT revealed a dense fatty lesion adjacent to the posterolateral parasellar region on the left with multiple small, dense fat droplets scattered in the subarachnoid space corresponding to a dermoid cyst rupture. Cranial MRI sections revealed a lesion with mixed-signal-intensity and multiple hyperintense droplets scattered through the cerebellar surface on the left. No enhancement was found on axial T1-weighted MRI after intravenous Gadolinium administration. Diffusion weighted image (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient map studies exhibited explicit restricted diffusion. Many studies and literature case reports concerning the rupture of dermoid cyst have been reported. However, multimodal imaging of this rare pathology in the same patient is uncommon. Although dermoid cysts are pathognomonic in appearance on a CT examination, the MRI is also of value in helping to understand the effect of extension and pressure of the mass. DWI is also important for support of the diagnosis and patient follow-up.",24505228
Psychotic symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus.,"Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus due to idiopathic aqueductal stenosis is a chronic abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the cerebral ventricles caused by an obstruction in the Sylvian aqueduct. This leads to a dilatation of the ventricular system and to subsequent damage of the adjacent parenchyma. Although NPH typically presents with the progressive 'triad' of cognitive impairment, gait disturbance and urinary incontinence, it has been described that it rarely manifests in the form of predominant psychotic symptoms. It has been suggested that thought and perceptual disorders could develop secondary to the damage caused by NPH. Although precise anatomical correlates have not yet been established, certain cerebral regions -primarily the frontal cortex, mesencephalic and diencephalic structures of the brain- have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalic psychosis. Because frontal lobe lesions are traditionally known to facilitate one's inability to integrate and correct perceptual distortions in the face of contradictory evidence, frontal lobe dysfunction may be integral in delineating the etiology of delusions in NPH. We present the case of a 30-year-old female, admitted involuntarily to our acute psychiatric department because she exhibited aggressive behavior while being in an agitated state with delusions of persecution. Her neurological examination disclosed subtle bradykinesia. Neuropsychological batteries and intelligence testing revealed mild cognitive impairment and a CT scan showed considerable dilatation of the ventricular system due to idiopathic aqueductal stenosis. While a conservative approach was chosen for the treatment of NPH, our patient was initiated on 2nd generation antipsychotics showing marked improvement of her psychiatric symptomatology. The atypical presentation of hydrocephalus in the aforementioned case underlines the necessity to thoroughly investigate the possible presence of an underlying organic factor in those patients who present with predominant psychotic symptoms in association with soft non-localising neurological signs and mild cognitive deficits. Furthermore, our patient's marked improvement indicates that, in cases where the primary cause is treated conservatively, hydrocephalic psychosis could respond to 2nd generation antipsychotics. In light of this case report, we reviewed past and present literature on the matter.",24185090
[Psychotic disorder induced by Fahr's syndrome: a case report].,"Fahr's syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by abnormal deposits of calcium in areas of the brain that control movement, including the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex associated with many neurological and psychiatric abnormalities such as a rigid hypokinetic syndrome, mood disorders and cognitive impairment. Fahr's syndrome is secondary to some disorders, such as hypoparathyroidism. We report the case of a 56 year-old man, with a history of cataract, who was admitted to our psychiatric hospital for the first time in his life because of psychotic symptoms associated with irritability and aggressiveness. Since the age of 38 the patient had become nervous, 10 years later he developed tonic-clonic seizures. Two months ago, he began expressing delusions of persecution against his wife and sons and making fugues. According to his family during this period, he was agitated, aggressive, and suffered from insomnia and anorexia. The general and psychiatric examination showed an upright and bronzed patient with neglected hygiene. He was indifferent to his environment and expressed poor mimics and gestures. He was anxious, suspicious and not very talkative. He was conscious but his attention was slightly decreased. Moreover, he was not aware of his problems. The neurological examination showed extrapyramidal syndrome with postural tremor and cerebellar ataxia. A cranial computed tomography brain scan found bilateral, symmetric basal ganglia calcifications, in favour of Fahr's syndrome. Phosphocalcic investigations revealed low concentration of serum calcium at 1.01mmol/L (normal 2.15 to 2.57mmol/L) and hyperphosphoremia at 2.69mmol/L (normal 0.81 to 1.55mmol/L). He also had low concentrations of 25-OH vitamin as well as decreased urinary levels of phosphate and calcium. The blood level of parathyroid hormone was 0ng/L. The diagnosis of Fahr's syndrome, revealing a hypoparathyroidism was posed. He was supplemented with calcium and alpha cholecalciferol and treated with clozapine (100mg per day). After four weeks, psychotic symptoms responded well to this treatment without expressing any side effects, notably seizures. Psychotic symptoms seen in Fahr's disease include auditory and visual hallucinations, complex perceptual distortions, delusions, and fugue state. Some of them were manifest in this patient. It is likely that the psychosis in both Fahr's disease and schizophrenia share a similar pathology. Positive psychotic symptoms, hallucinations, and paranoia are not necessarily generated by the classical hypothesis of dopamine-mediated attachment of salience to internally generated stimuli. Still, there is some evidence that disruption of the cortex involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is also seen in Fahr's disease, particularly in areas of the limbic system. Psychiatrists should consider Fahr's syndrome as a differential diagnosis in the evaluation of psychosis associated with seizures. This case, along with others in the literature, further emphasizes the importance of the role of neuro-imaging and the search for disrupted phosphocalcic metabolism in patients with atypical psychotic symptoms. Moreover, further research should focus on pharmacologic interventions. The efficacy and risks of neuropharmacologic and psychopharmacologic interventions in Fahr's syndrome, and correlates of good and poor outcome with these interventions remain to be defined.",23816059
[Psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment in neurosarcoidosis. Case report and review of literature].,"Clinical involvement of the nervous system occurs in about 5% of patients with sarcoidosis. We describe a fatal case of a young patient with neurosarcoidosis with a relatively rare psychotic syndrome in the course of neurosarcoidosis, presenting itself as a depressive syndrome with delusions. The neurological manifestations consisted of cerebellar symptoms, peripheral neuropathy and general epileptic seizures. Cerebrospinal fluid examination, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level, magnetic resonance imaging, chest radiography, gallium isotope scanning and other tests were used as diagnostic tools. He was treated with steroids, methotrexate and neuroleptics ineffectively. The patient died because of complications related to neurosarcoidosis. The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was confirmed by autopsy.",23479950
Acute neuropsychiatric disorders in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome: Japanese case reports.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate acute neuropsychiatric disorders in adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome. We report 13 Japanese adolescents or young adults with Down syndrome who developed acute neuropsychiatric disorders including withdrawal, depression, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and occasional delusions or hallucinations. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED FROM EACH PATIENT: age at onset of acute neuropsychiatric disorder, complications, signs and symptoms, personality traits before the onset of the acute neuropsychiatric disorder, prescribed medications with their respective doses and the response to treatment, and senile changes observed on magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. The mean age at onset of these disorders was 21.2 years. Brain imaging showed almost senile changes; patients responded well to low-dose psychotropic therapy. Patients had an onset at a young age and presented with treatable conditions, although the average age of the onset of Alzheimer's disease is generally over 40 years of age in patients with Down syndrome. These findings suggest that the pathology of acute neuropsychiatric disorder in patients with Down syndrome may be related to presenile changes; however, these disorders present features and a clinical course that is different from those presented in typical Alzheimer's disease with Down syndrome.",22888254
Alcohol-induced persistent mild cognitive impairment with successful withdrawal from alcohol dependence--a case report.,"An 81-year-old man diagnosed with alcohol-induced persistent mild cognitive impairment consulted our clinic presenting with gait disturbance. Between the ages of 20 and 53 years, his alcohol consumption was 1.8 liters of alcoholic sake per day. However, from the age of 53 years onward, his consumption decreased to 360 ml per day. The patient had alcoholic neuropathy, mild cognitive impairment, and alcoholic cerebellar disorder. His score on the revised version of Hasegawa's Dementia Scale (HDS-R) was 22 and his clinical dementia rating (CDR) was 0.5. His score on the Japanese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 22. These scores indicated mild cognitive impairment (MCI). He had delusions and confabulations, without impairment of date and place orientation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated enlarged ventricles, sulcal widening, and brain atrophy. He was provided with medication and counseling to treat his alcohol abuse. He accepted our treatment and is presently doing well after 1 year 2 months of treatment.",21675042
[Case report of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis suspected of schizophrenia].,"Recently, paraneoplastic encephalitis associated with ovarian teratoma, which predomi nantly affects young women, has been reported. Its symptoms are severe but often treatment-responsive and reversible. Various psychiatric symptoms occurring shortly after onset are characteristic of this encephalitis. A 22-year-old female who had a fever and common cold-like symptoms presented with short-term memory loss. She was suspected to have viral encephalitis, but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed no marked change. Shortly after that, she developed delusions and hallucinations and presented with psychomotor excitement. She was suspected of having schizophrenia and admitted to the psychiatry department. However, several days after admission, she showed upper limb convulsion, orofacial dyskinesias, and central hypoventilation and became unresponsive. The results of laboratory tests were within the normal range, and there was no marked elevation of anti-viral antibody titers. Brain imaging was normal, but a solid tumor containing soft tissue and calcified components, probably an ovarian teratoma, was discovered on an abdominal CT scan. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibody was positive in her CSF and blood serum, and we diagnosed her with ""Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis"". Gamma globulin was very effective, and the ovarian teratoma was removed. Finally, she could be discharged from our hospital without any sequela, and returned to her job. Psychiatrists often encounter encephalitis patients with psychiatric symptoms. If the type of encephalitis is unknown, we should keep this disease in mind.",20136036
"A young woman with visual hallucinations, delusions of persecution and a history of performing arson with possible three-generation Fahr disease.","Fahr disease (FD) is a rare neurological and psychiatric disorder. The disease is classified by intracranial calcification of the basal ganglia with the globus pallidus region being particularly affected. We examined a young woman with visual hallucinations, delusions of persecution and a history of performing arson with possible third-generation FD. Case report of third-generation FD. A 23-year-old woman was arrested for two arsons: i) The patient exhibited progressive psychotic symptoms, including visual hallucinations, delusion of injury, irritability, lability of mood, mental retardation and visual disorders and ii) Computed tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated bilateral calcifications of the basal ganglia (globus pallidus) in the patient, her mother and her grandmother. We found a family with a three-generation history of FD who exhibited calcification in the brain and mental retardation. Compared to her mother, the patient described here displayed anticipation of disease onset.",19522881
[Behavior disturbances in emergency psychiatry or fronto-temporal dementia diagnosis? A challenge for psychiatrists].,"The diagnosis of fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) represents a challenge for the psychiatrist, especially since this insidious pathology partly mimics other psychiatric diseases. We present a clinical case that illustrates the difficulty of FTD diagnosis particularly well. A 32 year-old woman without previous medical history presented with psychomotor agitation, logorrhea and flight of ideas. The criteria for bipolar disorder according to DSM IV were met and the patient was referred to an outpatient clinic where a mood stabilizer was initiated (lithium, 400 mg/day). An in-depth interview with her husband revealed mild but progressive modification of her personality and behavior over the course of two years. She showed signs of mild fatigue and irritability that evolved into a loss of interest for both leisure and domestic activities. In addition, she showed increasing erratic behavior and emergence of frequent episodes of verbal abuse. After the birth of her second child, the patient's clinical state worsened with the appearance of uninhibited behavior, loss of personal hygiene, sleep disturbances and nightmares. The patient was forced to stop her work as a cleaner, a steady employment that she had maintained for 10 years. The hypomanic state worsened and psychotic symptoms such as delusions and echolalia appeared within a few weeks. These events culminated in a first hospitalization in a psychiatric unit. We evoked both diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. In the following months, we conducted neurological examinations on account of the progressive deterioration of her cognitive functions. Neuroradiological results (CT scan with contrast agents, MRI, cerebral scintigraphy) coupled with her clinical evolution (neurological examination and neuropsychological testing) permitted diagnosis of fronto-temporal dementia. Fronto-temporal dementia usually presents itself as an autosomal dominant disease in 89% of reported cases, with an insidious onset associated with thymic symptoms and behavioral disturbances. The first consultation often concludes with a suspicion of a psychiatric disorder in 33% of the cases (unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders, psychotic disorders, alcohol dependence). The clinical description of such a heterogenic and neuro-psychiatric disorder should be widely disseminated, so that psychiatrists can distinguish early symptoms and diminish the risk of misdiagnosis of FDT. Such case reports emphasize the importance for psychiatrists to be aware of the clinical prodromal FDT symptoms, particularly since the neuro-imaging data of dementia are often delayed.",17099602
[Acute psychosis and Behçet's disease: a case report].,"Behçet's disease is a multisystem vasculitis of unknown origin. The prevalence of the disease varies widely and is high in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, North Africa, Iran and Japan. Many clinical features of Behçet's disease have been described and the international study group for Behçet's disease has defined a set of diagnostic criteria. These require the presence of recurrent oral ulcers plus two of the following: recurrent genital ulcerations, typical defined eye lesions, typical defined skin lesions or a positive pathergy test (a skin hypersensitivity reaction to a non-specific physical insult; when positive, the response consists of a papule or pustule that develops after 24 to 48 hours at the site of a needle prick to the skin). Although not included in these diagnostic criteria, there are some other features commonly seen in patients with Behçet's disease: thrombophlebitis, oligo-arthritis, gastrointestinal ulcerations and neurological involvement. Neuro-Behçet is well described in Behçet's disease, with variable prevalence rates between 5.3 and 35%. This prevalence is probably affected by the type of study (retrospective or prospective) and regional and ethnic variations in disease expression. Psychiatric symptoms usually occur as incidental findings in some patients with neurological disease; they are misdiagnosed and mistreated. The patient described here developed acute psychotic symptoms without parenchymal cerebral involvement, and negative symptoms during Behçet's disease. Two hypotheses were evoked: schizophrenia associated with Behçet's disease versus psychiatric syndrome induced by vasculitis. Such a case has not been reported in the literature. We describe the case of a 31-year-old Haitian female, admitted because of an acute psychosis. She developed hallucination, misrecognition, psychomotor hyperactivity and delusion about her million childbirths. The patient had three years history of mistreated Behçet's disease, in particular recurrent oral ulcers, iritis and cardiovascular manifestations. She also had a history of uterine tumour, rectal carcinoid tumour and recurrent pleurisies. One year ago, she presented breast lymphangitis, anxiety, unusual thought content, hostility, suspiciousness, and poor impulse control: cranial computerised tomography scan was normal. After ten days of hospitalization, she complained of oral and genital aphta and no neurological sign was found. The cerebral angiographic magnetic resonance imaging showed a thrombophlebitis of the left lateral sinus without parenchymal involvement. Haloperidol, Heparin, Colchicine, Cyclophosphamide and Prednisone were introduced. Six months after, delirium and Behçet's symptoms had disappeared with the following treatment: Risperidone, Alprazolam, Zolpidem, Colchicine, Prednisone, and Azathioprine. The patient has developed enduring negative symptoms: blunted affect, social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation and poor rapport. They are still present. This patient had two acute psychotic symptoms without parenchymal pattern. After treatment, she had persistent negative symptoms and psychosocial deterioration. This evolution is commonly seen in schizophrenia. Retrospective analysis of this patient's course suggests that -psychiatric episodes were always associated with physical manifestations. However, pleurisies, lymphangitis, uterine and rectal tumours have never been described in Behçet's disease. This vasculitis occurs less frequently in the Caribbean than in Mediterranean, Middle East or Japan. It seemed that this patient had a psychotic syndrome and a chronic relapsing multisystem disorder, more complex than Behçet's disease. A prospective study would be useful to characterize psychiatric patterns of Behçet's disease and establish their relationships with physical manifestations, especially neurological involvement.",16840933
Evaluation of regional cerebral blood flow in fahr disease with schizophrenia-like psychosis: a case report.,"We report the case of a patient with Fahr disease presenting with schizophrenia-like psychosis for whom a technetium Tc99 methyl cysteinate dimmer brain study was used to evaluate regional blood flow. A brain single photon-emission CT study showed increased cerebral blood flow to the bilateral temporal lobes. Such perfusion abnormalities may reflect psychotic symptoms, including auditory hallucinations and delusions, which suggests a disruption of the cortico-subcortical neural circuits in psychosis.",16286395
Cotard's syndrome with schizophreniform disorder can be successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy: case report.,"We report a case of Cotard's syndrome associated with psychotic symptoms. A 27-year-old man was admitted to hospital with the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. His presenting symptoms, which had started 1 month before hospital admission, were somatic delusions of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular malfunction and the absence of a stomach, which resulted in a decrease in weight from 75 kg to 63 kg in 1 month. Cranial computed tomographic images showed dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles, whereas magnetic resonance imaging revealed central atrophy and lateral ventricle dilatation. Single- photon emission computed tomography demonstrated left temporal, left frontal and left parietal hypoperfusion. The patient did not respond to antipsychotic therapies, but he was successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy. This report emphasizes that Cotard's syndrome may be accompanied by lesions of the left hemisphere and that electroconvulsive therapy could be the first-line therapy in such patients with psychotic disorder.",15069468
[Frontal dementia or dementia praecox? A case report of a psychotic disorder with a severe decline].,"Many authors have described these last years the difficulty to establish a differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and frontotemporal dementia. However treatment and prognosis of these two separate diseases are not the same. Schizophrenia is a chronic syndrome with an early onset during teenage or young adulthood period and the major features consist of delirious ideas, hallucinations and psychic dissociation. However a large variety of different symptoms describes the disease and creates a heterogeneous entity. The diagnosis, exclusively defined by clinical signs, is then difficult and has led to the research of specific symptoms. These involve multiple psychological processes, such as perception (hallucinations), reality testing (delusions), thought processes (loose associations), feeling (flatness, inappropriate affect), behaviour (catatonia, disorganization), attention, concentration, motivation (avolition), and judgement. The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia have often been conceptualised as falling into three broad categories including positive (hallucination, delision), negative (affective flattening, alogia, avolition) and disorganised (poor attention, disorganised speech and behaviour) symptoms. No single symptom is pathogonomonic of schizophrenia. These psychological and behavioural characteristics are associated with a variety of impairments in occupational or social functioning. Cognition impairments are also associated with schizophrenia. Since the original clinical description by Kraepelin and Bleuler, abnormalities in attentional, associative and volitional cognitive processes have been considered central features of schizophrenia. Long term memory deficits, attentional and executive dysfunctions are described in the neurocognitive profile of schizophrenic patients, with a large degree of severity. The pathophysiology of schizophrenia is not well known but may be better understood by neuronal dysfunctions rather than by a specific anatomical abnormality. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is one of the most common causes of cortical dementia. FTLD is associated with an anatomical atrophy that can be generalised, with a frontotemporal or focal lobar predominance. Histologically there is severe neuronal loss, gliosis and a state of spongiosis. In a minority of case Pick cells and Pick bodies are also found. The usual clinical features of FTLD are divided in three prototypic syndromes: frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive non-fluent aphasia (PA) and semantic dementia (SD). FTD is the most common clinical manifestation of FTLD. FTD is first characterised by profound alteration in personality and social conduct, characterised by inertia and loss of volition or social disinhibition and distractibility. There is emotional blunting and loss of insight. Speech output is typically economical, leading ultimately to mutism, although a press of speech may be present in some overactive, disinhibited patients. Memory is relatively preserved in the early stage of the disease. Cognitive deficits occur in the domains of attention, planning and problems solving, whereas primary tools of language, perception and spatial functions are well preserved. PA is an initial disorder of expressive language, characterised by effortful speech production, phonologic and grammatical errors. Difficulties in reading and writing also occur but understanding of word meaning is relatively well preserved. In SD a severe naming and word comprehension impairment occur on the beginning in the context of fluent, effortless, and grammatical speech output. There is also an inability to recognise the meaning of visual percepts. The clinical syndromes of FTLD are associated with the brain topography of the degeneration. So considerable clinical overlap can exist between schizophrenia and FTLD and the object of the following case report is to remind the difficulty to make a differential diagnosis between these two pathologies. A 34 year old non-married man is admitted in mental health district of a general hospital for behavioural disturbances that include repeated aggressions towards his family. At initial interview visual and auditives hallucinations are described. The patient doesn't care about these abnormalities and a poverty of speech is observed. The affects, globally blunted, show some degree of sadness however. The patient's birth and early development were unremarkable. At the age of 26, the patient dismissed from his job because of poor performance and absenteeism. He spent a lot of time watching TV, showed poverty of speech and become sometimes angry and violent without an explanation. He was hospitalised for several months and a schizophrenia including predominant negative features, hallucinations and delusion was diagnosed. He was treated with bromperidol, could go back to home and was followed by a general practitioner for 8 years. The patient had a stereotyped way of life during these years with a poor communication and little activity. During the months preceding the current hospitalisation, these characteristics and avolition emphasised, urinary incontinence appeared. The patient receives risperidone 8 mg/day associated with citalopram 40 mg/day during several months of hospitalisation. No significant evolution is observed regarding apathic and stereotyped way of live. The capacity of communication remains very poor. Neurocognitive assessments reveal multiple and severe dysfunctions. Memory, executive and attentional tasks are extremely disturbed. Physical and neurological examinations reveal an isolated bilateral Babinski sign. Cerebral scanner and magnetic resonance show bifrontal atrophy and PET scan is normal. There are no significant abnormalities found on blood and urine samples and on lumbar puncture. The patient is sent to a chronic neuropsychiatric hospital and the treatment is stopped. One year later, a comparative evaluation is realised. The general clinical state shows no evolution. Neurocognitive assessments are repeated and severe dysfunctions are observed with more perseverations. A diagnosis of FTLD for this patient can be discussed regarding clinical features, neurocognitive testings and neuroradiological findings. Schizophrenia is a major differential diagnosis. Psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and age of onset are essential observations for the diagnosis of schizophrenia but can not exclude FTLD. Memory, intellectual functions, executive and attentional abilities may all be disturbed in schizophrenia and FTLD. Cerebral abnormalities well established in schizophrenia are lateral ventricles enlargements. Frontal lobar atrophy is a major argument for FTLD and is only a sporadic finding in schizophrenic populations. Schizophrenia and FTLD could be comorbid diseases by several ways. A differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and FTLD is difficult to establish. Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease with a large variety of cognitive dysfunctions. Neurocognitive tools may improve our knowledge of schizophrenia.",14567169
Brief psychotic disorder associated with bereavement in a patient with terminal-stage uterine cervical cancer: a case report and review of the literature.,"We report here a terminally ill patient with uterine cervical cancer who developed a brief psychotic disorder after bereavement following the loss of three close friends also suffering from gynecological cancer. A 49-year-old housewife, who was diagnosed as having uterine cervical cancer and was receiving palliative care was referred for psychiatric consultation because of an abrupt onset of delusions, bizarre behavior, disorganized speech, and catatonic behavior. On psychiatric examination, she showed delusional thought and catatonic behavior. Laboratory data were unremarkable, as was brain MRI. She had no history of psychiatric illness or drug or alcohol abuse. After receiving haloperidol, psychiatric symptoms disappeared, and she returned to the previous level of functioning after 3 days. The patient explained that the death of three of her friend due to gynecological cancer was shocking event for her. She focused her attention on her own fears of dying from the same disease. Brief psychotic disorder in cancer patients is rare in the literature. However, our report of brief psychotic disorder associated with bereavement may highlight possible precipitating factors, which have not been adequately emphasized in the literature to date. From a clinical perspective, it would be informative for liaison psychiatrists to inquire about the patient's experience of loss of significant others with the same disease. This may provide useful information helpful to understanding the patient's conception of the disease process. Cancer patients' bereaving friends who had cancer is not rare in clinical settings. Therefore, medical staff should be mindful of interpersonal relationships between patients and bereavement arising from these relationships.",12690544
Left temporal rhythmic electrical activity: a correlate for psychosis? A case report.,"It is well recognized that epileptic patients are at higher risk for acute or chronic psychotic states than non-epileptic subjects. Here we present intracranial depth electrode recordings during a psychotic episode in a 20-year-old woman who was referred for presurgical evaluation. Unrelated to her seizures, she presented acoustic hallucinations and delusions and became agitated for a duration of 18-24 hours. During this period, a new unusual pattern of sharp slow waves was seen semi-rhythmically every 2-3 sec from left anterior neocortical temporal areas. Her condition responded well to a treatment with Haloperidol, but not with Benzodiazepines. Ictal and interictal scalp- and depth-EEG recordings outside the psychotic episode as well as MRI-based volumetry, PET, SPECT and neuropsychological testing gave evidence of bilateral temporal and frontal dysfunction. This case report suggests that psychosis in epileptic patients may be based on a bilateral cerebral dysfunction linked together in a pathological network, but with a focal (here: left temporal) driving mechanism.",10907737
[A case of glioblastoma manifesting 49 years after lobotomy].,"We report a case of glioblastoma manifesting 49 years after a lobotomy. He was diagnosed as having schizophrenia at age 20 and was operated on with a standard lobotomy when he was 27 years old. He had led a useful life after 40 years old without medication. Because of hallucination and delusion, he was hospitalized at the end of 1996. CT showed a well enhanced tumor adjacent to the cavity made by the lobotomy in the left frontal lobe. This is the second case report of glioblastoma just beside the cavity formed by lobotomy. The relationship between glioblastoma and old lobotomy is discussed, especially in regard to morphology and CT findings.",9757470
MRI and SPECT of Klinefelter's syndrome with various neuropsychiatric symptoms: a case report.,"We present here magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computed tomography with 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP-SPECT) of a patient suffering from Klinefelter's syndrome with various neuropsychiatric symptoms. He was a 30-year-old male, who showed impaired consciousness seizures, auditory hallucination, delusion of reference, delusion of grandeur, psychomotor excitement and intellectual impairment. Although no focal lesion was detected by computed tomography or T1-weighted MRI, T2-weighted MRI provided a heterogeneous high-signal-intensity lesion of the inferior part of the left temporal lobe, which was not enhanced with Gd-DTPA. In addition 123I-IMP-SPECT exhibited focal hypoperfusion in the left temporal lobe on the early images. We suggest that the neuropsychiatric symptoms of this case are associated with the focal organic brain dysfunction which was revealed by MRI and 123I-IMP-SPECT.",7911167
Frontal lobe tumor associated with late-onset seizure and psychosis: a case report.,"This is a report of a 55-year-old woman with a 6-year history of uncontrollable complex partial seizure and severe delusion. A computed tomography (CT) brain scan showed a nonenhanced low density area with an ill-defined mass located at the right frontal lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an area of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. After a tumorectomy, the patient gradually recovered from the seizures and delusion. A histological diagnosis showed a mixed oligoastrocytoma or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT). The clinical and pathological features of the tumor as well as its relation to psychosis were discussed.",8301867
Palinopsia as an epileptic phenomenon.,"The preservation or recurrence of images in the visual field after removal of the real stimulus is called 'palinopsia' or 'visual perseveration' which can be split up into three different types according to the latency between the real external stimulus and its apparent recurrence. For a long time it was subject of discussion whether the delusion is a sign of lacking cortical inhibition or of a cortical afterimage or part of an epileptic seizure. If there are different reasons for the three sorts of visual perseveration has not been answered yet. In our case report, however, it is possible to demonstrate a patient's posttraumatic lateralized long-latency visual perseveration for the first time as a clear-cut focal epileptic seizure which is approved by synchronous temporo-parietal epileptic discharges in the electroencephalogram.",2606136
